								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Do you know &#8220;dd&#8221;? No ? This is a small GNU binary, surely one of the most essential that could exists. It allows you to do a lot of things. It cas even make your USB devices/SD cards &#8220;bootable&#8221;.</p>
<p>For those who are already a lost, know that when you want to &#8220;burn&#8221; an operating system in order to install it, the real action is to make your device ( USB key, SD card, external hard drive &#8230;) &#8220;bootable&#8221;. For the purists, I&#8217;m aware that it&#8217;s not exactly that but hey! Keep in mind that you read a &#8220;reminder&#8221; 🤠</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/ajIAehf.jpg"></p>
<figure> &#8220;dd&#8221; would not sound like the diminutive for the Mother of Dragons? </figure>
<p></center></p>
<p>The issue with this wonder of nature (dd, not Daenerys !!) is that like many wonders of that kind, you have to put your hands in the grease to use it because it&#8217;s not for beginners on Mac OS nor Windows. This is why there are essentially only people who have already been able to manipulate a Linux who know &#8220;dd&#8221;.</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/oAdiJVV.jpg"><figcaption> This gentleman seems to know &#8220;dd&#8221; </figcaption></center></p>
<p>Until you taste to a Linux, here is a solution I&#8217;ve been using for a quite long time already: &#8220;Etcher&#8221; (or newly &#8220;Balena Etcher&#8221;).</p>
<p>The advantage with &#8220;Etcher&#8221; is that it&#8217;s one of those cross-platform and ultra-simplistic applications I like. Indeed Etcher can as well run on Linux, Mac OS or even Windows.</p>
<p>The interface is hyper simplistic:</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/Vw5Ymue.png"></center></p>
<p>There are literally three buttons, I don&#8217;t think we can do more &#8220;user friendly&#8221; </p>
<p>Thus, to make any storage bootable, you must:</p>
<p>1 °) Select the image .iso/.img of the operating system you want to install<br />
2 °) Select the removable storage (USB key, external hard disk, SD card, &#8230;)<br />
3 °) &#8220;Flash!&#8221; or press the last button to make the removable storage &#8220;bootable&#8221; 🤠</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/iZrydEH.jpg"></p>
<figure> I wouldn&#8217;t said better 🤠</figure>
<p></center></p>
<h3> Verdict </h3>
<p>Etcher does not replace &#8220;dd&#8221; but allows you at least to make ALL (and I mean all) devices you attach to your computer fully &#8220;bootable&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which is, it must be admitted, quite useful when you break your Linux because of a bet with your friends and you&#8217;re in trouble because the only computer available to flash your USB stick is an old fashioned Mac OS or a rotten Windows (Sounds like there&#8217;s a story 🤠)</p>
<p>In addition, I find this tool puts a real order in all the whole bunch of &#8220;Unetbootin,&#8221; Rufus &#8220;,&#8221; Linux live iso &#8220;and derivatives of all kinds which I find too unnecessary difficult to use .</p>
<p>Voilà ! I hope you enjoyed this article, don&#8217;t hesitate to make your own idea and comment. We don&#8217;t change good habits, if you found this little DIY useful, spread it ! I&#8217;ll see you soon for a new article!</p>
<p>Until then, stay cool with monkeys and drink water because water is water and water is life !!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>If as me, you live in a cave, know that Microsoft will stop the Skype project development!</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/joV1k1sNOT5xC/giphy.gif" alt = "skype"><figcaption> When Microsoft announced it quietly 🤠 </figcaption></center> </p>
<p>I realize that some people won&#8217;t even find the usefulness of making a post on it but for the others (and I know a lot !) who can&#8217;t simply imagine the word &#8220;Videoconference&#8221; rhyme with anything other than Skype, I have something that might interest you:</p>
<h3> Wire </h3>
<h3> 1 °) What is it? </h3>
<p>Wire is above all a compagny but it&#8217;s also a fully open source and cross-platform software, which means that you can install it either on Linux, Mac OS, Android, IOS or even Windows. But before you install it, there are several &#8220;plans&#8221; a bit like slack for those who know. So you can create two kinds of account on the site &#8220;business&#8221; (paying) or &#8220;personal&#8221; (free), a mail and a password are more than enough to create a personal account.</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKrugYn6cXQAMTK/giphy.gif" alt = "applause"><figcaption> Minimalism folks, minimalism 🤠 !</figcaption></center></p>
<h3> 2 °) Features </h3>
<p>Once your account is created and the app is installed, there&#8217;s not much left to do:</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/wire-screenshot-2.jpeg" alt = "macos"><figcaption> Wire on Mac OS 🤠 </figcaption></center>You can do everything as you would do on Skype, create conversation groups, add people to contacts, share your screen or your camera, share images,&#8230; All of that without having this feeling of being constantly monitored by the NSA or any other privacy killer. Indeed, all communications are encrypted end-to-end ! Which means that except the person you are chatting with, no one will know that your dog is called Medor, and not even Wire!</p>
<p>Here is the icing on the cake: Wire does not serve any ads (yup, it is still possible in 2019).</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/5VKbvrjxpVJCM/giphy.gif" alt = "macos"><figcaption> The epic face I&#8217;ve made when I saw there was 0% of ads 🤠 </figcaption></center></p>
<h3> 3 °) Verdict </h3>
<p>You may have already understood it, I&#8217;m totally under the spell of Wire. I have honestly tried a myriade of replacements to Skype and even Discord (yes, yes it&#8217;s possible), but every time there was something wrong. Except for Wire, where everything works like a charm, the quality of the audio, the design, everything is tasty!</p>
<p>Voilà ! I hope you enjoyed this post, don&#8217;t hesitate to make your own idea and comment. We don&#8217;t change good habits, if you found this post useful, spread it ! I&#8217;ll see you soon for a new article!</p>
<p>Until then, stay away from barbed wire and enjoy free <del>candies</del> softwares !!</p>
<p>NB: I&#8217;m not paid by Wire, it&#8217;s only my personal opinion about it ! </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but when I made my hacking debut and the only language I could &#8220;master&#8221; was Batch, I didn&#8217;t know about Linux!</p>
<p>the sake of mercy don&#8217;t judge me, I&#8217;m already ashamed enough to write it!</p>
<p>I was a real newbie, I even thought that all big hacking operations was done on Windows (I was so naive). One day a classmate reveals me the existence of BackTrack 5 r3 (newly GNU Kali Linux), I was so excited to do my very <strong> FIRST </strong> moves in the hackers world. Everything being, of course, emulated into a virtual machine (Virtual Box at the time  🤠), because I quote you &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to break my computer 😣&#8221; (ah ah, what so cute&#8230;)</p>
<p>Why am I telling you all this? It&#8217;s quite simple, when I was younger, Windows hacking distributions didn&#8217;t exist&#8230;</p>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cYOMBDF.png" alt="capture" /></center><br />
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KSkcVsS.png" alt="capture" /></center></p>
<p>Now, they do.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/RVZD5dJ5fviUg/giphy.gif" alt="meme" /></center></p>
<p>To be completely honnest with you, I&#8217;ve completely missed out the news to such an extent that if I&#8217;m writing this post, it&#8217;s only because some of you asked me what I think about it&#8230; (don&#8217;t hesitate to continue to write to me, it&#8217;s a pure delight to read you).</p>
<p>Initially, I must admit that I believed in a prank or some fake news. That&#8217;s why I checked out by myself&#8230; I stayed a couple of minutes displaying a pretty good pokerface. In fact, I don&#8217;t know if I have to laugh or if I have to cry with laughter at the fact that &#8220;This time, it&#8217;s official, in 2019 Windows has finally two &#8220;distributions&#8221; and they are both oriented hacking&#8221;.</p>
<p>The regulars know, I like make fun of Windoze and perhaps besides it makes laugh only me but I find quite hilarious the fact of actually putting &#8220;Windows&#8221; and &#8220;Hacking&#8221; in the same sentence.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/HyvjlU00Ad4xq/giphy.gif" alt="hackerus windowsius" /><figcaption> an authentic specimen of hackerus windozius 🤠 </figcaption></center> </p>
<p>Seriously, I&#8217;ve tested these two Lin..Windows distributions and I can confirm you that they are as bloated af.</p>
<p>First of all, be aware that these two distributions are published by <strong> FireEye </strong>. For those who don&#8217;t know this name or would be a little more connected to video games, know that if <strong> Kaspersky </strong> is a bit the <strong> Ubisoft </strong> of computer security, <strong> FireEye </strong> is more the &#8220;Electronic Arts&#8221; (EA) of computer security. It indeed a big American company that has contracts everywhere in the world and which hunts for state-sponsored or more I like to say &#8220;ennemies&#8221;-state-sponsored hackers group with a non hidden pleasure.</p>
<p>In short, it&#8217;s the same entity that publishes these two distributions (which are closer to the software bundle than the real distribution).</p>
<p>So there are two bundles, the Malware Hunter/Forensic Engineer starter pack named &#8220;Flare VM&#8221; and the Pentester starter pack with Commando VM</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/eCqFYAVjjDksg/giphy.gif" alt="jean-hacker" /><figcaption> an authentic specimen of pentestus stated-powered in action🤠 </figcaption></center> </p>
<p>To install one of the two versions (Flare VM or Commando VM), you must first had installed a virtual machine with Windows 7, <del> 8 </del >, 8.1 or <del> 9 </del> 10. Then you have to naviguate to the github repository associated with the version (<a href="https://github.com/fireeye/flare-vm "rel="noopener noreferrer"target =" _blank "> https://github.com/fireeye/flare-vm </a> or <a href =" https:// github.com/fireeye/commando-vm "rel="noopener noreferrer"target =" _blank "> https://github.com/fireeye/commando-vm </a>) to download and run a powershell script &#8220;Install.ps&#8221;.</p>
<p>When the script installed for 60 GB of hard disk (Yup, it&#8217;s in the *MINIMAL* required) here you are with your wallpaper changed</p>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cYOMBDF.png" alt="capture" /></center></p>
<h3> OR </h3>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KSkcVsS.png" alt="capture" /></center></p>
<p>There you go ! You are left to do the same thing as on <strong> GNU Kali Linux </strong> but in a less good manner and in two different downloads. Remind me why I laughed previously for &#8220;Windows&#8221; and &#8220;Hacking&#8221; in the same sentence. Oh yeah ! Because, you can&#8217;t simply use Windows without an antivirus programm, so how about turning it off to investigate on malwares !!! </p>
<p>What do you say ? &#8220;Yes, but this is has been specialy designed for Windows&#8221;? Would I have heard in the back of the room ? Ha ha &#8230; You&#8217;re so naive &#8230;</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/fYsyULfLlvBzW/giphy.gif" alt="lol" /><figcaption> I&#8217;m sure about more than one &#8220;Windozian&#8221; will have this reaction at the end of article  🤠 </figcaption></center> </p>
<p>According to the github repository, &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/fireeye/flare-vm#pentest" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> https://github.com/fireeye/flare-vm # pentest </a> &#8220;to be more precise, it&#8217;s very clearly written that the&#8221; Pentest &#8220;part of Flare VM consists of&#8221; Windows binaries from Kali Linux &#8220;(Windows binaries from <strong> *GNU*</strong> Kali Linux). Thus, as you can imagine, it&#8217;s the same for Commando VM where again is specified &#8220;Windows binaries from Kali Linux&#8221; in addition to being confirmed in the &#8220;legal note&#8221; (<a href="https://github.com/fireeye/commando-vm#legal-notice "rel="noopener noreferrer"target =" _blank "> https://github.com/fireeye/commando-vm#legal-notice </a> for those who want to check).</p>
<p>Well, to enumerate the good points, there are some new features, as a semblance of package installer named <del"> *apt*</del > &#8220;cup&#8221;. You have also a brand new version 2.0 which brings, I quote you, &#8220;full of new changes&#8221; and which is obviously not installable via this same installer packages #wow.</p>
<p>In short, you may have already understood my point of view, I am far from agree to make my CTF&#8217;s or even my investigations on the heavily disabled twin brother of a poor &#8220;GNU Kali Linux&#8221;.exe</p>
<p>I may shoot on the messenger, but when I see the cost-benefit ratio of that idea, I simply can&#8217;t hold myself to tell me &#8220;Why?&#8221; :</p>
<p>Why try a distro on Windows when it just does not work! Seriously, you only have to look at the minimum required configuration: 4GB of RAM for 60GB of storage !!</p>
<p>Why not make a Linux distribution ? It would still have more credibility and viability than this 🙁</p>
<p>Why has it been necessary to wait to 2019 to see the first &#8220;hacking&#8221; distributions on Windows?</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/b8jefh8LnBmMw/giphy.gif" alt="questions" /></center></p>
<p>Until finding the answers of these philosophical questions surely without any answers though. You can still share the post to your friends or collegues if you want this site to grow. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m so happy every time when I see the number of visitors increasing, don&#8217;t hesitate to write me I read of course all your messages 🤠</p>
<p>Until then, stay away from fire and enjoy a relaxing shower !!</p>
