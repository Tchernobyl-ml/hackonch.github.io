								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hi everyone, </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start this article by a simple question, do you know what is a software bug ? Just to be sure, here&#8217;s a quick reminder :</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;A software bug is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. &#8220;</p><cite>Wikipedia</cite></blockquote>



<p>In our societies mostly powered by computers, bugs would be like real-life cheat codes. They could give you the power to break the matrix and do good or bad without ever leaving your confortable seat. The firsts to have understood it, was intelligence agencies all around the world.</p>



<p>You wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if I told you that these same persons are actually stockpiling every unreported bugs as potential <strong>cyberweapons</strong>.</p>



<h3>Bug Bounties and the way things are supposed to work </h3>



<p>Depending on the type of behavior, a bug can be quite valuable to discover, that&#8217;s why, software companies try to encourage bug reporting by offering to pay IT professionals and hackers a &#8220;bug bounty&#8221; of up to several thousand dollars to those who find them.</p>



<p>As instance, Twitter offered recently some <strong>$20,160.00</strong> for reporting a potential pre-auth remote code execution on the twitter&#8217;s virtual private network.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5VKbvrjxpVJCM/giphy.gif" alt=""/><figcaption>Well, that&#8217;s a pretty good bounty !</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>However, if these bugs are kept secret from the vendor, they become zero-day exploits for organizations as the CIA or any other government intelligence agencies. &#8220;Vault 7&#8221; leak on WikiLeaks revealed a culture wielding incredible power by hoarding these exploits at the expense of everyday citizens who rely on vulnerable infrastructure to run their lives. </p>



<p>These &#8220;superpowers&#8221; give criminals and government agencies the option to &#8220;skip&#8221; legal, constitutional, and technical questions faced by their behavior.</p>



<p>Even if companies offer bounties of up to a few thousands dollars for serious, newsworthy bugs, such efforts are meaningless with governments paying far more to keep these 0day exploits secret. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/DGkRR2874Yb5u/giphy.gif" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>Today, hackers are offered far more to keep bugs a secret for truly valuable exploits, particularly ones that compromise user&#8217;s privacy and cyber espionage</p>



<p>While some rewards miles from United Airlines might be alluring to an aspiring hacker, an exploit allowing tracking of international travel patterns might be worth real cash to a cyber-arms broker or government agency.</p>



<h3>Bugs as Zero-Day Exploits </h3>



<p>There&#8217;s a saying about artillery that applies to cyberweapons: &#8220;If the enemy is in range, so are you.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t take a lot of common sense to realize an exploit won&#8217;t remain secret if you try warn some people about it but not the others, leaving you just as exposed as the intended targets.</p>



<p>The revelation of the advanced capabilities of the NSA badly damaged faith in American tech companies. In response, the Obama administration acknowledged that it was possibly not a great idea to have all these great weapons that rely on zero-day exploits in devices American infrastructure runs on. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/oND3prYUKFgnm/giphy.gif" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>The administration, in the interest of national security, agreed to release critical bugs to vendors to enable the &#8220;hardening&#8221; of American devices and infrastructure.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t share this with Google for even $1 million.&#8221;</p><cite>Chaouki Bekrar, Vupen</cite></blockquote>



<p>At the opposite, many companies have sprung up that couldn&#8217;t care less about the bounties offered by software companies, such as French company Vupen, run by Chaouki Bekrar. When they attend hacking competitions, they keep the most valuable exploits for themselves.</p>



<p>&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t share this with Google for even $1 million,&#8221; Bekrar told Forbes. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to give them any knowledge that can help them in fixing this exploit or other similar exploits. We want to keep this for our customers.&#8221;</p>



<p>Vault 7 leaks has shown a culture that directly contradicts the Obama administration position, leading some security researchers to take selling zero-day exploits as a foregone conclusion. </p>



<p>Indeed, this precious leak showed that the CIA went against the administration policy, choosing instead to hoard exploits in a growing cyberwarfare capabilities arms race between some superpowers as the US, China, and Russia. </p>



<p>These weapons aim to cause casualties, damage, and destruction with a new type of warfare that has never been possible to wage before. Hoarding these zero days has real world consequences for users of these compromised devices, fueling a black market in cyberweapons that is just impossible to control.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o85fTbmA8BbUhJvri/giphy.gif" alt=""/></figure></div>



<h3>The Rise of Private Military Contractors in Cyberwarfare </h3>



<p>In war, PMCs (private military contractors) have been providing cost-saving value for governments since the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. Companies like Blackwater offered to solve problems the US government needed solved, and this has caused and explosion in the private arms market.</p>



<p>The legal showdown prompted by the FBI&#8217;s demand to Apple to produce iPhone malware drew international attention, but was suddenly resolved with a payment to an outside cybersecurity company. Just like that, a private contractor made over a million dollars to circumvent a legal process for the FBI. In fact, this is pretty common, with private cyberweapon marketplaces doing as much as $100,000,000 annually in sales.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jMMpNgA.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>This incident shed light on a growing trend of cyber mercenaries where companies specialize in weaponizing zero-day exploits for whoever pays them to. Like traditional arms brokers, the best paying customers are often those looking to do something illegal, criminal, or in violation of human rights. Groups like Hacking Team have been widely accused of enabling human rights abuses and selling cyberweapons to whoever will pay them, putting anyone with vulnerable devices at risk.</p>



<p>These weapons are known to proliferate and turn up domestically, trickling down to the civilian market as &#8220;spouse tracking&#8221; or &#8220;catch my spouse cheating&#8221; spyware to enable harassment, stalking, extortion, and other illegal activity. In particular, journalists and vulnerable people are routinely targeted by these less-elegant exploits of common vulnerabilities. But for hackers wanting to get paid, it&#8217;s often more profitable to sell interesting bugs to spies than to worry about end users affected by the vulnerabilities.</p>



<h3> The Growing Arsenal of Weapons Targeting an Increasingly Connected World </h3>



<p>As our lives become increasingly influenced by connected devices, it has never been easier to cause damage through the weaponized use of exploits. Once limited to taking down websites or erasing data, cyberweapons in 2019 have the capability to kill people and destroy physical infrastructure.</p>



<p>A tense political situation has caused an explosion in the grown of cyberweapons, with the military pumping government funds into the private sector to create new and more lethal weapons. </p>



<p>Unlike nuclear or conventional weapons, these weapons can be copied, transported, and used across the globe in a matter of seconds. The political value of these weapons, and the dazzling scope of power they provide, has led organizations like the CIA (Again) to create new and more interesting ways to make people vulnerable through the devices around them.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IydmRNCdEmqVchq/giphy.gif" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>Between the black and grey cyberweapons markets of zero-day exploits, and the government funded creation of more, these tools are growing increasingly sophisticated and powerful in scope. Thanks to the explosion in malware availability, users of modern technology globally are vulnerable to weapons that allow political control, extortion, and even national acts of sabotage or war.</p>



<p>In recent attacks in the Ukraine, Russia has deployed increasingly sophisticated cyberweapons in conjunction with disinformation attacks that deny citizens the right to an impartial understanding to the world around them.</p>



<p>The ability to present a person with false information from a supposedly trusted source and invade their private life represents a level of control and manipulation that can be abused and automated to a terrifying degree. </p>



<p>From invasive data collection, to targeted disinformation campaigns, to automated exploits of zero-day vulnerabilities, most users are unprotected against this kind of interference in their everyday lives.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/cteJ7ZUgPAJfq/giphy.gif" alt=""/></figure></div>



<h3>When Governments Stockpile Vulnerabilities, Private Citizens Lose Around the World</h3>



<p>An increasingly tense geopolitical situation is causing governments around the world to stockpile cyberweapons capable of destroying critical infrastructure and causing loss of life, while quietly testing and refining these weapons in global conflicts. </p>



<p>These weapons only work when governments pay to keep knowledge of these bugs secret and cyberweapons dealers accept payment to turn a blind eye to how their tools are used.</p>



<p>Everything from our traffic patterns to our understanding of what time it is relies on technology today. As we advance into a world of further automation and trust in the devices around us to run our lives and shape our understanding, we confront a the new reality of where technology fits into our lives today.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/JFmkQayDKwa5y/giphy.gif" alt=""/><figcaption>This situation about cyberweapons reminds you nothing ?</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Rather than safeguarding the world&#8217;s growing reliance on technology by disclosing and advancing development of zero-day vulnerabilities, the worlds governments are stockpiling methods of committing a new frontier of attacks against populations never targeted by such sophisticated weapons before.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>Users and developers of cyberweapons insist that the capacity is needed to track down terrorists and criminals using encryption and other methods that make them hard to trace. Copying these weapons, however, takes only a moment, and NSA tools developed to invade computer systems were recently lost only to resurface on the black market.</p>



<p>Criminals can buy software to spy on government employees, shut down power stations, disable metro fare collectors, or encrypt millions of dollars worth of data thanks to the diligent efforts of the NSA and private contractors working to satisfy government contracts.</p>



<p>As shown by the CIA leaks, the casual way in which government agencies have began to share purchased or developed exploits increases the proliferation of highly sophisticated malware and worsens the risk of it falling into the wrong hands. </p>



<p>Vault 7 documents show that the US and UK governments pay to join in on the fun of exploiting vulnerable devices under the promise to not warn vulnerable users in their own country or use the weapon on each other&#8217;s citizens—even though they could.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TYp1B3H.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption>Critical vulnerability in devices used by US citizens shared with a foreign government. Image by Edward Snowden/Twitter </figcaption></figure>



<p>The grey market purchase of a zero-day exploit in the Apple showdown prevented a potential constitutional confrontation that could have had far-reaching implications for digital privacy in America. Today, the cyber gray and black market provides governments a relief valve to attack the technology we rely on for privacy without outlawing encryption itself.</p>



<p>As these weapons grow in power and scale, we as citizen, need to debate and decide whether contributing to today&#8217;s stockpile of cyberweapons is worth putting the people around us, or around the world, at risk of having these tools used against them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>If you read me regularly, you should know how a fervent supporter of privacy I am. Sometimes, I can even turn myself into a genuine government agent and go as far as possible into investigating and find out those responsible for general mass attacks (<a href = "https://hackonch.ml/analysis-of-a-chinese-mass-attack-ft-codoso-team/" > here </a>) or, as more recently, attacks targeting a precise profile of users (<a href = "https://hackonch.ml/investigation-russian-phishing-campaign-via-text-messages-on-leboncoin/"> there </a>)</p>
<p>As you may guess with the title of this post, we are not going to visit this time the confines of Russia or China to investigate on dark individuals. Nope, I suggest you instead to take a look at threats hanging over us, or should I say in your house! Yep, in your house, right now, or even at your workplace.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2K5jinAlChoCLS/giphy.gif" alt = "gif"/><figcaption>The reaction of many readers at this time of this post</figcaption></center></p>
<p>Indeed, with all these cases of mass espionage and high level hacking, there is IMHO too much a trend to neglect or even forget the risks of sending in the air its emails, its bank codes, its password or in one word: its data. Today, there are of course many so-called &#8220;wireless&#8221; protocols which allow us to send data to the air (Bluetooth, GSM, ZigBee, NFC, &#8230;). Today we will focus on one of the most used, you may have already guessed it and that&#8217;s the in the title of this post (coincidence?): WI-FI!</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/JEf4yZp4H1rMc/giphy.gif" alt = "gif"/></center></p>
<h3> A bit of history </h3>
<p> Wi-Fi is a set of standards for wireless networks developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE 802). Its first standard is published in 1997, and allows exchanges at a theoretical speed of 2 Mbit/s (it&#8217;s very slow nowadays). The set has been enhanced in 1999, with the publication of IEEE 802.11a and 802.11b standards which increase the theoretical throughput rate to 54 Mbit/s as well as a privacy protection system: the famous WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy). </p>
<p> It&#8217;s for WI-FI, the very first system to protect users against hackers. Except that<strong> Firstly </strong>, WEP was an option and therefore, a lot of people simply disregarded it. <strong> Secondly </strong>, in short, WEP used a robust encryption algorithm for that time. The fact, is we saw about 10 seconds ago that the performances had been increased by X27 between 1997 and 1999. You understand then that it was not necessary to wait a long time to be able to break the encryption used by WEP. For the cryptoaholics, the responsible all of this was the RC4 algorithm that breaks today less than ten seconds.</p>
<p> To replace WEP, in 2003 was designed WPA which is still widely used today. That&#8217;s why, if you check out your phone to find some wifi networks you should find a large number of WPA with a possibility of variant as WPA2 or WPA3 with a suffix &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;PSK&#8221; or &#8220;TKIP&#8221;.</p>
<p> <center><img src="https://pics.loveforquotes.com/%E7%B1%B3-wi-fi-looking-for-networks-turn-wi-fi-off-get-your-56421688.png" alt = "gif"/><figcaption> This one is a good one 🤭</figcaption></center> </p>
<h3> WPA in a few numbers </h3>
<p> Of course, WPA was not spared by vulnerabilities. But doing a little researches on our beloved Wikipedia, didn&#8217;t reveal a couple of flaws as WEP but: </p>
<p><center></p>
<h1> 9 flaws </h1>
<p> </center></p>
<p> Just that! But wait, this ins&#8217;t the worst part. Indeed, a few dozen known vulnerabilities in one of the most used protocols of the 21st century isn&#8217;t a bad sign but a pretty good one because it means that the publisher is aware of these flaws. In order to protect their customers, publishers can release a patch or even a workaround to continue to use the device safely until the patched version is released.</p>
<p> The real problem with WPA is that there is no versioning at all. Basically when WPA version 1.0 is released but unfortunately (or fortunately ?) in the meanwhile, some flaws are heard, these flaws are not patched immediately in a version &#8220;WPA version 1.1 patch&#8221;. No, no, no and there is the worst part ! When flaws are found, for example, on version 1.0 it is necessary to wait for the second version &#8220;WPA2&#8221; to hope to see them patched. If it&#8217;s reassuring for some people to see vulnerabilities patched in a year with WPA to WP2, how about waiting for:</p>
<p> <center></p>
<h1> 14 YEARS !!! </h1>
<p> </center></p>
<p> Yep, between WPA2 to WPA3 there is 14 years 🤠 ! But it&#8217;s even funnier than that because most of the Wi-Fi vendors haven&#8217;t even implemented an <strong>UPDATE</strong> function on their devices. We could almost believe that they were not even expecting a third WPA standard 🤠! It&#8217;s a NO-NO even for those big companies that everyone uses their chips without knowing it. Well you have to believe that it is quite normal today to drive with a 14 year old car that we know the brakes can actually breake at any time!</p>
<p> <center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/OongkSFTbly8w/giphy.gif "alt =" gif "/><figcaption> YOLO as we say 🤠 </figcaption></center> </p>
<h3> Did you know ? </h3>
<p> Do you know the principle of &#8220;Did you know? &#8220;? Usually, I don&#8217;t say no, but with WI-FI, we will have a good time, I can guarantee it!  </p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p> If you see some SSID (The names of Wi-Fi networks, eg FBI Surveillance) it also means that you are actually receiving the network packets of different devices connected to those networks. As each packet contains a header to know which network it is connected to, we can determine how many devices are connected to a network. Another important field, the MAC address that is defined by the manufacturer of the device is also indicated. Which means that even without being authenticated to the network, I can know exacly  which and how many devices are connected to a network. Hell yeah ! Enjoy your privacy in 2019 🤠 !</p>
<p> <center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/1236TCtX5dsGEo/giphy.gif" alt = "gif"/></center></p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p> Wi-Fi implements a function to deauthenticate all users on a network, quite useful if you want to annoy all your neighborhood !</p>
<p> <center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/XreQmk7ETCak0/giphy.gif "alt =" gif "/></center></p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p> On public Wi-Fi networks , everyone has access to everyone&#8217;s data, so if you are enjoying a tasty Happy Meal at a well-known restaurant and for any reason you are connecting to your Minecraft server in FTP, the Wi-Fi hotspot will actually sends your password in clear in the air within an area of 26 576,97 m² (the maximum range of a wifi hotspot being 92 m indoors)</p>
<p> <center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/OqBEghKMTW79m/giphy.gif" alt = "gif"/><figcaption> this packet is afraid to be intercepted 🤠 </figcaption></center> </p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p> There is actually no control to know who is whom on a wifi network. For instance, if I deauthenticate you from your wifi router, and I sneak to your doorstep to turn on a fake access point with the same name of your real access point. There is no way for you to say &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s a bad guy at my doorstep performing a traffic redirection &#8220;. You will simply give me all your data including all your passwords thinking that it&#8217;s your usual connection.</p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p>There is still a significant number of Wi-Fi networks still under WEP in the world. For example, in 2015, 36.5% of Wi-Fi networks in Paris could be accessed without any password, and no less than 61.5% of Wi-Fi networks were password protected but used a poor encryption method such as, for example, just totally random picked: WEP. The study was carried out on &#8220;Avenue de l&#8217;Opera&#8221;, along the Seine and up to Notre-Dame de Paris, where 7,523 Wi-Fi networks belonging to hotels, cafés, offices and private residences were identified.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPznTgmcQGOlqyA/giphy.gif" alt="gif" /><figcaption>Don&#8217;t even think about getting free WI-FI !! 🤠</figcaption></center></p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p>Since August 2010, boxes with less than € 5 that work without human intervention, automatically search for WEP connections 1 km away, decode them and thus provide a free Internet connection to any computer connected to it, regardless of the system. exploitation. they also allow by extension to listen to the network in order to capture all the passwords that circulate on it. All as anonymous as illegal.</p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p>China has its own national standard to replace WPA named WAPI for WLAN Authentication Privacy Infrastructure.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9KVAN7Jvn22hekdG/giphy.gif" alt="gif" /><figcaption>This country will never stop surprising me 🤔</figcaption></center></p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p>Although WPA3 is supposed to be operational since January 2019, its key feature called OWE for &#8220;Opportunistic wireless Encryption&#8221; is still unavailable. If this feature was available, it would make the example of the Minecraft FTP connection over the hotel wifi just impossible. Even if according to Wikipedia, an attack of this kind is still possible even with OWE. Well, WPA3 remains a colander, a modern colander certainly, but a colander anyway!</p>
<h5> Verdict </h5>
<p>For better or for worse, Wi-Fi is ubiquitous today and although it&#8217;s quite practical and effective in terms of speed, Wi-Fi is all but privacy friendly.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there is far too few quality of what user get at the end. We are deploying always more Wi-Fi hotspot, always more powerful, ever more practical, but without solving the real problems it poses. I&#8217;ll say it right away, don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m carpeting into my cave with a foil hat and screaming &#8220;BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING ME&#8221; all the time !</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the first to use Wi-Fi in hotels or in McDonald&#8217;s between two French-fries with ketchup to watch youtubes poop videos. However, I think that Wi-Fi problems are a bit like Iphones, we always add new innovative features and make sure to fully exploit the potential of the device without solve the problem #1 which could break everything: the battery with Iphones and the privacy what is,even more important. </p>
<p>Voilà ! I hope you enjoyed this article, do not hesitate to make your own idea on the subject and comment.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Do you use Adblock, Ublock or any other extension to block ads? In my case, I do so. It&#8217;s quite simple, I simply can not use a browser if I do not have an ad blocker installed!</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/ynmzKmA.jpg" style = "width: 50%; height: 50%" /><figcaption></center>A meme that explains my situation quite well 🙂 </figcaption>The problem with this kind of extensions is that they use a lot of processor/memory resources in addition to having to be installed on a browser to work. I know right, there are some browsers with built-in ad blockers but sometimes we just have neither the browser choice nor the ability to install an extension.</p>
<p>Sometimes we just want it to work, like a charm, naturally, without having anything to do, on all devices, pretty out-of-the-box though.</p>
<p>If you think as me, then you are at the right place, because today I suggest you this little tutorial <a href="https://blog.tchernobyl.ml/category/diy/"> DIY </a > in order to definitively end the ads.</p>
<h3> Ingredients: </h3>
<p>&#8211; a Raspberry Pi 🍓 (sorry there was no more raspberry emojis)<br />
&#8211; an SD card, a 4 GB SD card should be more than enough.<br />
&#8211; an USB power supply (if you don&#8217;t have the official Raspberry power supply on hand, your <strong> USB </strong> phone charger is enough.<br />
&#8211; a Linux distribution, the most popular on Raspberry Pi being Raspbian, we will use Rapsbian, but any distro does the trick!<br />
&#8211; another computer (to configure our Raspberry)</p>
<h3> Prepare the ground: </h3>
<p>Usually, when unbox your Raspberry Pi, there is nothing installed, let&#8217;s fix this by plugging your SD card into the SD card reader of your other computer to install Raspbian as specified on this little <a href="https://blog.tchernobyl.ml/diy/etcher-or-make-a-usb-bootable-on-linux-mac-os-or-meme-windows/"> tutorial </a></p>
<p>After that, we activate the SSH service of our Raspberry Pi by going into the boot partition (and not the /boot folder at the root).Once you are in the right partition, simply create an empty file named &#8220;ssh&#8221;.</p>
<p>Insert the SD card into the raspi port and you&#8217;re good to go. Turn everything on and SSH-connect to the Raspberry Pi:</p>
<p><Pre><br />
ssh pi @ [LOCAL_RASPI_ADDRESS]<br />
</Pre></p>
<p>The default password is: &#8220;raspberry&#8221;</p>
<p>You can achieve that with the Bash terminal on Unix OS&#8217;s (Linux, BSD&#8217;s, Mac OS&#8230;) or with Putty on Windows</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/YJJ5KN3.png" /><figcaption></center>we put the IP of the Raspberry in the IP field </figcaption><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/e4pV7nU.png" /><figcaption></center>then we put the word of 🙂 </figcaption>Once you have the remote control over the RPI, change at least the password of the default user to ensure a minimum security with the command:</p>
<p><Pre><br />
pi @ raspberry: ~ $ passwd<br />
Current password: &#8220;raspberry&#8221;<br />
New password: [ANYTHING_BUT_&#8221;raspberry&#8221;_!_!_!]<br />
Confirmation of password: [the same password as previously entered 🤠]<br />
</Pre></p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to talk about the solution I chose: &#8220;Pi-Hole&#8221;. It&#8217;s a free and Open-Source solution, simplistic as hell which allows us to solve our little advertising problem in a quite intuitive and efficient way. Indeed, once we have implemented the solution, the Raspberry will play the role of &#8220;filter&#8221;.</p>
<p>The installation of Pi-Hole is very simple:</p>
<pre>
pi @ raspberry: ~ $ curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
</pre>
<p>the script should start:</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/rHChPdC.png" /><figcaption></center>What a raspberry &#8230; 😍 </figcaption></center></p>
<p>We run the installation script by navigating with the arrow keys on the keyboard until this step which I think is the most important of all. Those who read my article on <a href = "https://blog.chernobyl.ml/diy/les-dns-or-how-to-review-the-control-on-the-life-privates-a-step -a-time / "rel="noopener noreferrer"target =" _ blank "> DNS </a> (<a href =" https://blog.tchernobyl.ml/diy/les-dns-or-how- -repert-the-control-on-its-private-life-a-step-at-a-time / "rel="noopener noreferrer"target =" _ blank "> here </a>) will know what to choose 🤠.<br />
<center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/wnfcdov.png" /></center></p>
<p>Once the installation is complete, the address of an administration page and your password to access it are given, remember the password ! If you prefer another password, you can always change it via the command:</p>
<pre>
pi@raspberry:~ $ sudo pihole -a -p
</pre>
<p>Once everything is set up we just check that the admin page works, if all everything is fine you should deal with a page like this:</p>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/s6aW8Yq.png" /></center></p>
<p>From there, you can configure Pi-Hole at your leisure or put finer settings if you wish. The advantage with this tool is we actually can monitor everything and potentially block everything, so please be careful to become a mini NSA or a Big Brother ! ☹️</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/0oYW3Ta.jpg" /><figcaption></center>This is typically the example not to follow 😥 </figcaption></center></p>
<p>From now on, you do as you feel! Indeed, you have three deployment choices:</p>
<p>&#8211; The sweet way, by replacing the DNS IP address on your router by the IP address of your Raspberry Pi. That way, It will change for you the DNS server settings of all other devices on the network.</p>
<p>&#8211; The fine way (or &#8220;case by case&#8221;), by changing the the DNS IP address of each device you want to &#8220;free&#8221; of ads.</p>
<p>&#8211; The radical way, disable DHCP from your router and let the Raspberry do it all alone via the built-in DHCP server.</p>
<p>The three methods will of course work. It only depends on how you choose to work. Personally I have a preference for the sweet way, because it is the one that I think is the least headache. For example, if you buy a new device, no configuration is required for this device because it will automatically retrieves the Raspberry IP address via your router.</p>
<h3> Verdict </h3>
<p>To have tested Pi-Hole, I must admit that this is the kind of solution as I like. Namely very easy to install, ultra simple to configure because it&#8217;s this kind of solution that will be the most effective. All served with a tastefully documentation that of course allows you to go further.</p>
<p>Voilà ! I hope you enjoyed this article, don&#8217;t hesitate to make your own idea and comment. We don&#8217;t change good habits, if you found this little DIY useful, spread it ! I&#8217;ll see you soon for a new article!</p>
<p>Until then, stay cool and drink water because water is life !</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>If as me, you live in a cave, know that Microsoft will stop the Skype project development!</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/joV1k1sNOT5xC/giphy.gif" alt = "skype"><figcaption> When Microsoft announced it quietly 🤠 </figcaption></center> </p>
<p>I realize that some people won&#8217;t even find the usefulness of making a post on it but for the others (and I know a lot !) who can&#8217;t simply imagine the word &#8220;Videoconference&#8221; rhyme with anything other than Skype, I have something that might interest you:</p>
<h3> Wire </h3>
<h3> 1 °) What is it? </h3>
<p>Wire is above all a compagny but it&#8217;s also a fully open source and cross-platform software, which means that you can install it either on Linux, Mac OS, Android, IOS or even Windows. But before you install it, there are several &#8220;plans&#8221; a bit like slack for those who know. So you can create two kinds of account on the site &#8220;business&#8221; (paying) or &#8220;personal&#8221; (free), a mail and a password are more than enough to create a personal account.</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKrugYn6cXQAMTK/giphy.gif" alt = "applause"><figcaption> Minimalism folks, minimalism 🤠 !</figcaption></center></p>
<h3> 2 °) Features </h3>
<p>Once your account is created and the app is installed, there&#8217;s not much left to do:</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/wire-screenshot-2.jpeg" alt = "macos"><figcaption> Wire on Mac OS 🤠 </figcaption></center>You can do everything as you would do on Skype, create conversation groups, add people to contacts, share your screen or your camera, share images,&#8230; All of that without having this feeling of being constantly monitored by the NSA or any other privacy killer. Indeed, all communications are encrypted end-to-end ! Which means that except the person you are chatting with, no one will know that your dog is called Medor, and not even Wire!</p>
<p>Here is the icing on the cake: Wire does not serve any ads (yup, it is still possible in 2019).</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/5VKbvrjxpVJCM/giphy.gif" alt = "macos"><figcaption> The epic face I&#8217;ve made when I saw there was 0% of ads 🤠 </figcaption></center></p>
<h3> 3 °) Verdict </h3>
<p>You may have already understood it, I&#8217;m totally under the spell of Wire. I have honestly tried a myriade of replacements to Skype and even Discord (yes, yes it&#8217;s possible), but every time there was something wrong. Except for Wire, where everything works like a charm, the quality of the audio, the design, everything is tasty!</p>
<p>Voilà ! I hope you enjoyed this post, don&#8217;t hesitate to make your own idea and comment. We don&#8217;t change good habits, if you found this post useful, spread it ! I&#8217;ll see you soon for a new article!</p>
<p>Until then, stay away from barbed wire and enjoy free <del>candies</del> softwares !!</p>
<p>NB: I&#8217;m not paid by Wire, it&#8217;s only my personal opinion about it ! </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Do you know what net neutrality is? If you don&#8217;t, here&#8217;s a quick reminder from Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Net neutrality or network neutrality is a principle that guarantees the equal treatment of all data flows on the Internet. This principle excludes, for example, any positive or negative discrimination with regard to the source, destination or content of the information transmitted over the network. </p></blockquote>
<p>I also remember that a few years ago it really made the buzz when the United States had decided bottle it, plenty of stars from all walks of life had shown their dissatisfaction with this measure that was profitable only for those juicy operators as AT&#038;T, Verizon and so on &#8230;</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/UOOrmYpZPwRm8/giphy.gif" alt = "US"></center></p>
<p>In Europe, fortunately, the institutions are still *against* the big companies wishing to end it (but for how long?).</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/l3mZ99WVXIFIGsZY4/giphy.gif" alt = "EU"></center></p>
<p>But if for any reason you&#8217;re in doubt about your Internet Service Provider (ISP), you can still do this simple<a href = "https://ip.lafibre.info/neutralite.php" rel="noopener noreferrer"target =" _ blank "> test </a> (<a href="https://ip.lafibre.info/neutralite.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> https: // ip.lafibre.info/neutralite.php </a>)</p>
<p>It couldn&#8217;t be easier :</p>
<p>Two pictures must be downloaded, one via HTTP, the other one via HTTPS, if one of the two pictures is lighter than the other then you are in trouble !!!</p>
<p>Indeed, if you notice a difference of size, then it is necessary to compare with reference one (ex: for the first picture, 43 225 bytes):</p>
<p>If it is the image in HTTP which is smaller, it may mean that your ISP is manipulating the images to reduce their size (and splutter in the process the principle of net neutrality 😠).</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/1236TCtX5dsGEo/giphy.gif" alt = "Bravo!"></center></p>
<p>If on the other hand it&#8217;s the HTTPS one, then you should quickly disconnect/reconnect your router and redo the test because it may be surely the sign that your internet connection is not safe 😰 !!!</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/xT39D0tJm471uhvhaU/giphy.gif" alt = "AV"><figcaption> This is called a good &#8220;Firewall&#8221; 🤡 </figcaption></center></p>
<p>In my case, I&#8217;ve made a small script that gave me this result:<br />
<Pre><br />
[✓] IMAGE_HTTP: 43,225<br />
| ✓] IMAGE_HTTPS: 43,225</p>
<p>[✓] The ISP is neutral!</p>
<p></Pre><br />
<center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/26tPo1I4XyWzIBjFe/giphy.gif" alt = "content"><figcaption> Yes, I pretty does the same in my room when I saw the results 🤠 </figcaption></center></p>
<p>I &#8216;ve written this script with Shell, because I honestly don&#8217;t know any lighter and easier langage on Linux/Mac OS&#8230;Nevertheless if you are the &#8220;happy&#8221; &#8220;&#8221; possessor &#8220;&#8221; of a Windows or if you just want to see me code a script for this beautiful and very friendly operating system #sarcasm don&#8217;t hesitate to let me know, I would be happy to help (it will be an opportunity to make a Github repository for the blog)!</p>
<p>Voilà ! I hope you enjoyed this post, don&#8217;t hesitate to make your own idea and comment. We don&#8217;t change good habits, if you found this post useful, spread it ! I&#8217;ll see you soon for a new article!</p>
