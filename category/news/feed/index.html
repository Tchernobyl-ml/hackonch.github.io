								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>As you may already know, I like to pamper the site. I&#8217;ve been preparing for a long time a checklist to always optimize the site and why not, improve it.</p>
<p>I checked about 95% of the checklist. Everything worked like a charm except a small detail I&#8217;ve forgotten: the visibility. </p>
<p>In all honesty, I have to admit that at the very beginning, I didn&#8217;t care that much. All I wanted was to keep a small site to train to write by writing some articles on this or that and why not, give my opinion if a couple of persons pass through there.</p>
<p>The time has passed and the traffic on the site has rapidly exploded. For comparison, earlier I said that I was happy if a couple of persons visite the site but today it&#8217;s 60 000 people who go there every month!</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xTiTnw6Yg5nzWwQh5C/giphy.gif" alt="awesome" /><figcaption>THAT&#8217;S PRETTY AWESOME !<br />
</figcaption></center></p>
<p>Well, we must admit, it&#8217;s not the same traffic as Google or Amazon, but it still remains not bad at all for a small non-profit blog !</p>
<p>All this to say that the site&#8217;s policy has slightly changed and will continue to evolve. Here is a little recap for more clarity:</p>
<h3>What won&#8217;t change:</h3>
<ul>
The blog will continue to promote Privacy.<br />
The blog will remain Anti-Google, Anti-Amazon, Anti-Facebook, Anti-Apple, Anti-Microsoft (anti-GAFAM in short) and thus, Pro-OpenSource, Pro-GPL and Pro-Linux.</ul>
<h3>What has changed:</h3>
<ul>
The blog is now available in several languages â€‹â€‹(English and French).<br />
The blog will adopt a small banner about the use of cookies in accordance with regulations imposed by the CNIL.<br />
The blog tends to popularization (Explanation of acronyms and technical terms, definitions links &#8230;)</ul>
<p>And finally the most important point: The blog gets a new look with a new name, &#8220;hackonch.ml&#8221;.<br />
Indeed, search engines used to drown too often the site under a ton and a half of links related to the Chernobyl catastrophe. It would be like making a website called &#8220;terminator&#8221;, you could always advertise it, but it would still be a real hassle to access it via search engines. In addition, many people took the site for a joke with &#8220;Tchernobyl&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why there will be a redirection to this domain name. Attention, although quite useful, this redirection is only temporary! Remember to update the link in your favorites or press Crtl + D!</p>
<p>VoilÃ ! See you soon for a new article (already in preparation). In the meantime, feel free to share and follow me on twitter (link below)</p>
<p>In the meantime, stay well, be kind to your pets and drink water!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>How you doin&#8217; ? For my part, it was a month of hard work with the pretty *huge* work I&#8217;ve done on the website. But now, I can finally get comfortably seated in a reclining chair and enjoy a fresh lemonade !</p>
<p>For the article part, I&#8217;m preparing a new investigation for your greatest pleasure, and mine too !</p>
<p>Oh yes, I almost forgot! As some have already noticed, the comments and the contact form are broken ðŸ˜“. But don&#8217;t panic ! I&#8217;ve officially launched a few days ago an official Twitter account dedicated to the blog to overcome these little inconveniences ðŸ¤ </p>
<p>See you soon for new articles and don&#8217;t hesitate to follow the blog on Twitter !</p>
