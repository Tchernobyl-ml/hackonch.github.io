								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>As you may already know, I like to pamper the site. I&#8217;ve been preparing for a long time a checklist to always optimize the site and why not, improve it.</p>
<p>I checked about 95% of the checklist. Everything worked like a charm except a small detail I&#8217;ve forgotten: the visibility. </p>
<p>In all honesty, I have to admit that at the very beginning, I didn&#8217;t care that much. All I wanted was to keep a small site to train to write by writing some articles on this or that and why not, give my opinion if a couple of persons pass through there.</p>
<p>The time has passed and the traffic on the site has rapidly exploded. For comparison, earlier I said that I was happy if a couple of persons visite the site but today it&#8217;s 60 000 people who go there every month!</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xTiTnw6Yg5nzWwQh5C/giphy.gif" alt="awesome" /><figcaption>THAT&#8217;S PRETTY AWESOME !<br />
</figcaption></center></p>
<p>Well, we must admit, it&#8217;s not the same traffic as Google or Amazon, but it still remains not bad at all for a small non-profit blog !</p>
<p>All this to say that the site&#8217;s policy has slightly changed and will continue to evolve. Here is a little recap for more clarity:</p>
<h3>What won&#8217;t change:</h3>
<ul>
The blog will continue to promote Privacy.<br />
The blog will remain Anti-Google, Anti-Amazon, Anti-Facebook, Anti-Apple, Anti-Microsoft (anti-GAFAM in short) and thus, Pro-OpenSource, Pro-GPL and Pro-Linux.</ul>
<h3>What has changed:</h3>
<ul>
The blog is now available in several languages ​​(English and French).<br />
The blog will adopt a small banner about the use of cookies in accordance with regulations imposed by the CNIL.<br />
The blog tends to popularization (Explanation of acronyms and technical terms, definitions links &#8230;)</ul>
<p>And finally the most important point: The blog gets a new look with a new name, &#8220;hackonch.ml&#8221;.<br />
Indeed, search engines used to drown too often the site under a ton and a half of links related to the Chernobyl catastrophe. It would be like making a website called &#8220;terminator&#8221;, you could always advertise it, but it would still be a real hassle to access it via search engines. In addition, many people took the site for a joke with &#8220;Tchernobyl&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why there will be a redirection to this domain name. Attention, although quite useful, this redirection is only temporary! Remember to update the link in your favorites or press Crtl + D!</p>
<p>Voilà! See you soon for a new article (already in preparation). In the meantime, feel free to share and follow me on twitter (link below)</p>
<p>In the meantime, stay well, be kind to your pets and drink water!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>How you doin&#8217; ? For my part, it was a month of hard work with the pretty *huge* work I&#8217;ve done on the website. But now, I can finally get comfortably seated in a reclining chair and enjoy a fresh lemonade !</p>
<p>For the article part, I&#8217;m preparing a new investigation for your greatest pleasure, and mine too !</p>
<p>Oh yes, I almost forgot! As some have already noticed, the comments and the contact form are broken 😓. But don&#8217;t panic ! I&#8217;ve officially launched a few days ago an official Twitter account dedicated to the blog to overcome these little inconveniences 🤠</p>
<p>See you soon for new articles and don&#8217;t hesitate to follow the blog on Twitter !</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p>Do you know Baldr? No ? Let me rephrase my question. Do you cheat on games like Counter Strike, Apex Legends, PUBG or in a nutshell on any other popular games ?</p>
<p>If the answer is yes, well, you have to consider your house being the next target of the Area 51 facebook storm group because it&#8217;s due to people of your kind that I just can&#8217;t manage to get Prestige 70 on Cole Off Douty Modern Advanced Warfare 3 !! </p>
<p>Well, more seriously, you have to know that some quacks have managed to make profit of cheaters by making a botnet essentially composed of&#8230; cheaters !</p>
<h3>1 °) The infection </h3>
<p>To spread their virus, the Baldr team has decided to make quite credible videos to cheat on a whole bunch of games, the whole uploaded on our beloved Youtube. You know, this same Youtube that did the &#8220;spring-cleaning&#8221; recently by deleting a whole bunch of hacking related videos. Irony of fate or real stroke of genius, their videos are still online on YouTube even after this so-called and so contested cleansing. Since they don&#8217;t do things in half, they also advertised their videos on Discord mainly to attract <del>cheaters</del> gamers.</p>
<p>These videos are posted from several accounts and they all have a link in the description. The link leads to an archive, which once unzipped and injected into the game&#8217;s files, can actually permit to cheat on the game, either by shooting faster or by seeing the enemies through the walls.</p>
<p>Well, that was the funny part or as I like to call it &#8220;the immersed part of the iceberg&#8221;. Let&#8217;s now see the submerged one, namely the less fun part.</p>
<h3>2 °) The submerged part of the iceberg</h3>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nspthUt.png" alt="price" ><figcaption>Not expensive at all 🤠</figcaption></center></p>
<p>Yes, as you see, Baldr steals all the passwords on the computer, including passwords that has been stored by the browser or by any other applications (such as Discord or FileZilla for instance) and then send them to the hacker who will eventually sell every account for a few dollars on the Dark Net. </p>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5yQGWvB.jpg" alt="and it's not over" ><figcaption>And it&#8217;s not over !</figcaption></center></p>
<p>Baldr turns also your PC into a well-docile zombie that will attack other computers with your Internet connection ! Oh, I see the crowd starting to make a fuss ! Unfortunately, this is still the best case, because your beloved Internet connection can also be rented, at prices that would get sick any Internet Service Provider, as an anonymous proxy or even worse, as a tor hidden service.</p>
<p>Oh I almost forgot the classic and the inevitable cryptocurrency mining !! Yeah, because even CPU usage is profitable to Baldr.</p>
<h3> 3 °) The origins </h3>
<p>So where does this evil beast come from? At first sight, it seems that Baldr was sold for the first time on underground forums hosted in Russia. </p>
<p>But, is Baldr really the sordid invention of Russian pirates? That&#8217;s another question.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VjQqbNl.png" alt="stats" /><figcaption> Some cool stats 🤠</figcaption></center></p>
<p>Indeed, when we sit down and look for ten seconds the statistics of infections, we realize that Indonesia won the race with 21.85% against 14.14% for Brazil and it is only at the third place that Russia appears with <strong>*only*</strong> 13.68%. </p>
<p>Moreover, the code does not contain any sign of Cyrillic characters, everything is coded in a perfect English. There are also many similarities with other abominations of that kind like Azorult or GrandStealer because we can even talk about copy-paste</p>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uUjnkUC.png" alt="comparison" /><figcaption>Left: Azorult NetscapeToJSON cookie converter function, Right: Baldr NetscapeToJSON cookie converter function 🤠 </figcaption></center></p>
<p>And here is the icing on the cake: the software vendors has sent a note the May 31st to all customers in which they explain that the developer decided to stop the project. But rather than maintain themselves the software, these gentlemen kindly call their customers (mainly Russian by the way) to look for a replacement.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XK2ny0Q.png" alt="note" /><figcaption>The mysterious note from Baldr vendors</figcaption></center></p>
<h3> 4 °) What is Baldr concretely? </h3>
<p>For me, Baldr belongs to a well-defined category of malware that I like to define with the following definition:</p>
<p>threat.exe: (mass name) Malware targeting <strong> *only* </strong> Windows, which is not very sophisticated but is still massively spreaded / used, thanks to &#8220;cyberkiddos&#8221; on «««hackers»»» forums (please note the quotation marks)</p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m about to break a myth, when we search a little bit on this kind of threat we generally reach the moment when we listen to a tutorial on how to build a genuine Russian botnet. The fact is, I quickly realized that the most of the time, the person talking is quite rarely more than 14 years old and tends to make videos on Roblox with all of its friends on its YouTube channel.</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/BoPbgjN.jpg" alt = "Oouuuh"><figcaption> Run for your lives !!! Here is the new generation of cybercriminals !!!! 🤠</figcaption></center></p>
<h3> 5 °) How to protect yourself + How to know if you are infected? </h3>
<p>Most of the time, when I&#8217;m dealing with these &#8220;threats.exe&#8221; many peoples tell me that I actually didn&#8217;t say how to protect ourselves or at least how to detect the infection. I&#8217;ll use this post to answer once and for all:</p>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Kamy9Dw.jpg" alt="true" /><figcaption></figcaption></center></p>
<p>I know, this is not the expected answer coming from a cybersecurity professional but this is the sad trust. Windows is a real colander, Windows 10 may be a more modern collander but a still a collander bloated and bugged as heck.</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.pinimg.com/564x/ab/55/45/ab5545fba7c959d690d898f94cc70ecb--friday-humor-windows-.jpg" alt = "the same ones speak for themselves"><figcaption> memes talk by themselves 🤠</figcaption></center></p>
<p>Security is a completely ABSENT concept on Windows, updates are a real clusterfuck, there is still a lot of Windows perfectly updated which are still prone to be exploited to vulnerabilities patched for ages <strong><em> #Eternalblue </em></strong>.</p>
<p>The very concept of antivirus, is a real aberration! If a system is well done, it is well done, that&#8217;s all. There is no need to fill any gap in its security.</p>
<p>Finally, I don&#8217;t know for you, but when I buy a tire for example, I don&#8217;t have to buy a coating to seal any hole on the tire ? Or I&#8217;ve been definitely fooled by a quack !</p>
<p>That was for the protection, the detection now! On Windows, you may not know it, but when you simply &#8220;listen&#8221;, with no open program, what your Windows sends on the Internet, you end up with this after only 30 seconds:<br />
<center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/9R8pfPv.png" alt = "capture"></center></p>
<p>This is a network capture made with Wireshark, an open source software. We can see on this frame capture that all in pale green or dark gray is all the communications your Windows has established with Microsoft telemetry servers.</p>
<p>On paper, telemetry allows Microsoft to know how you use your Windows. Of course, you are supposed to know what it is because during the installation of Windows, Microsoft actually asked your permission, but it&#8217;s absolutely normal that you have accepted because if you had refused, the installation would be aborted.</p>
<p>Microsoft simply violates your privacy with your permission.</p>
<p>Establishing a system that would filter all transmissions and that would drop suspicious transmissions (so, as a firewall) is simply impossible on Windows, it&#8217;s for this reason that no antivirus vendor has ever tried the maneuver. This is also why we never put firewalls on Windows clients, otherwise they don&#8217;t connect to Internet.</p>
<p><H3> Conclusion </h3>
<p>All of this to say once and for all that if you&#8217;re tired of your computer being abused by 13 year-olded kids or web giants, you can simply look for the alternative that suits your needs. I could also make it the subject of a future article if it interest you.</p>
<p>Voilà, I hope you like this article. Do not hesitate to share it with your friends or colleagues! </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to be happy, it&#8217;s the most important and see you soon!<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>A short time ago, one of my friends passionate into pentesting told me an anecdote. I want to make it clear that it is 100% truth and it happened in a medium-sized IT services company based in the US. Here we go !</p>
<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p>Last week, I was given access to a network that seemed at first sight quite secure.</p>
<p>As I am a little curious, the first thing I did when I settled was to run a network scan to see how many hosts were active and to have a vague idea of ​​the IS (Information System) of the company. All I had as information at this point was my IP address which informed me the address range of the floor. It was a tasty /24 as we like at a maximum of 254 hosts for the floor.</p>
<p>So I let nmap do his job with the information I had and when it finished, almost all devices were directly visible. I launched nmap a second time on a random host to see if something change. I compared then the second result with the first and I found something interesting. As the port 445 was open on almost all machines, I tried to launch an EternalBlue attack against a few hosts, but the connection failed every time I tried. Probably a firewall might block the connection but while trying to figure out what happened, I noticed another clue: a previously targeted device was named &#8220;PRINT-PC&#8221;.</p>
<p>Definitely curious about this strange device pretending to be a printer, I launched a third scan on it and I noted in addition to the Samba port (445) that the RDP port (3389) was also open. Naturally, I went to brute force the RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) password by taking care to use the username, I previously collected from the Eternalblue first try. After an &#8220;Eternal&#8221; minute, the software got stuck and repeats 1234 giving an error on each attempt. I open my RDP client to see what&#8217;s wrong and &#8230;</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.stack.imgur.com/o6GOJ.png" alt = "OMG" /><figcaption> The password was really 1234! 😱 </figcaption></center></p>
<p>I walked a little on the account I successfully broke in and, after digging a little, I found informations to say at least sensitive. About 2 GB of data in all. Afterwards, I didn&#8217;t miss to report the issue to the technical team.</p>
<p>It was at this exact moment, I had the worse idea that will, in less than 10 minutes, lead to a total chaos in the whole building. The idea was quite simple, if on a random floor, there is a device called &#8220;PRINT-PC&#8221;, it would probably mean that, there is a device called &#8220;PRINT-PC&#8221; on all other floors. No sooner said than done, I tried to connect to the same address by changing only the floor number with the same login. It worked once, twice, thrice and then I realized it would work with all other floors.</p>
<p>After that, I ran a well-known script to retrieve the NTMLv2 hashes to attempt a privilege escalation (the logical next step). Luckily I got almost all the hashes of all users in the building. The less glamorous thing though, was I made some noise in the network: the script broadcasted my IP on the PBX used by the staff directly from their machines and not from an external Cisco phone and that&#8217;s how after 5 minutes, I heard everyone complaining that &#8220;nothing was working&#8221;, not even the phones!</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/An4MkAbxeiyqY/giphy.gif" alt = "OMG" /></center></p>
<p>Despite all the panic, I still managed to do my little privilege escalation and open on a station near me a command prompt with the administrator rights! And although it&#8217;s true that just after, I had a hard time with the IT team, this story anecdote did my week!</p>
<h3> Conclusion </h3>
<p>Unfortunately, a poorly protected Windows printer server is enough to break all the security of an Information System. Add to the recipe a bit of luck (or bad luck) and you will an unseen chaos which can turn any normal day of a lambda employee into a remake of World War Z !!</p>
<p>Voilà ! I hope you enjoyed this short anecdote. Feel free to share it with your friends or colleagues! I&#8217;ll see you soon for a new article and why not a new story 🤠</p>
<p>In the meantime, be brave (why not ?), be kind with lamas and see you soon!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>If you read me regularly, you should know how a fervent supporter of privacy I am. Sometimes, I can even turn myself into a genuine government agent and go as far as possible into investigating and find out those responsible for general mass attacks (<a href = "https://hackonch.ml/analysis-of-a-chinese-mass-attack-ft-codoso-team/" > here </a>) or, as more recently, attacks targeting a precise profile of users (<a href = "https://hackonch.ml/investigation-russian-phishing-campaign-via-text-messages-on-leboncoin/"> there </a>)</p>
<p>As you may guess with the title of this post, we are not going to visit this time the confines of Russia or China to investigate on dark individuals. Nope, I suggest you instead to take a look at threats hanging over us, or should I say in your house! Yep, in your house, right now, or even at your workplace.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2K5jinAlChoCLS/giphy.gif" alt = "gif"/><figcaption>The reaction of many readers at this time of this post</figcaption></center></p>
<p>Indeed, with all these cases of mass espionage and high level hacking, there is IMHO too much a trend to neglect or even forget the risks of sending in the air its emails, its bank codes, its password or in one word: its data. Today, there are of course many so-called &#8220;wireless&#8221; protocols which allow us to send data to the air (Bluetooth, GSM, ZigBee, NFC, &#8230;). Today we will focus on one of the most used, you may have already guessed it and that&#8217;s the in the title of this post (coincidence?): WI-FI!</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/JEf4yZp4H1rMc/giphy.gif" alt = "gif"/></center></p>
<h3> A bit of history </h3>
<p> Wi-Fi is a set of standards for wireless networks developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE 802). Its first standard is published in 1997, and allows exchanges at a theoretical speed of 2 Mbit/s (it&#8217;s very slow nowadays). The set has been enhanced in 1999, with the publication of IEEE 802.11a and 802.11b standards which increase the theoretical throughput rate to 54 Mbit/s as well as a privacy protection system: the famous WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy). </p>
<p> It&#8217;s for WI-FI, the very first system to protect users against hackers. Except that<strong> Firstly </strong>, WEP was an option and therefore, a lot of people simply disregarded it. <strong> Secondly </strong>, in short, WEP used a robust encryption algorithm for that time. The fact, is we saw about 10 seconds ago that the performances had been increased by X27 between 1997 and 1999. You understand then that it was not necessary to wait a long time to be able to break the encryption used by WEP. For the cryptoaholics, the responsible all of this was the RC4 algorithm that breaks today less than ten seconds.</p>
<p> To replace WEP, in 2003 was designed WPA which is still widely used today. That&#8217;s why, if you check out your phone to find some wifi networks you should find a large number of WPA with a possibility of variant as WPA2 or WPA3 with a suffix &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;PSK&#8221; or &#8220;TKIP&#8221;.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://pics.loveforquotes.com/%E7%B1%B3-wi-fi-looking-for-networks-turn-wi-fi-off-get-your-56421688.png" alt = "gif"/><figcaption> This one is a good one 🤭</figcaption></center></p>
<h3> WPA in a few numbers </h3>
<p> Of course, WPA was not spared by vulnerabilities. But doing a little researches on our beloved Wikipedia, didn&#8217;t reveal a couple of flaws as WEP but: </p>
<p><center></p>
<h1> 9 flaws </h1>
<p></center></p>
<p> Just that! But wait, this ins&#8217;t the worst part. Indeed, a few dozen known vulnerabilities in one of the most used protocols of the 21st century isn&#8217;t a bad sign but a pretty good one because it means that the publisher is aware of these flaws. In order to protect their customers, publishers can release a patch or even a workaround to continue to use the device safely until the patched version is released.</p>
<p> The real problem with WPA is that there is no versioning at all. Basically when WPA version 1.0 is released but unfortunately (or fortunately ?) in the meanwhile, some flaws are heard, these flaws are not patched immediately in a version &#8220;WPA version 1.1 patch&#8221;. No, no, no and there is the worst part ! When flaws are found, for example, on version 1.0 it is necessary to wait for the second version &#8220;WPA2&#8221; to hope to see them patched. If it&#8217;s reassuring for some people to see vulnerabilities patched in a year with WPA to WP2, how about waiting for:</p>
<p><center></p>
<h1> 14 YEARS !!! </h1>
<p></center></p>
<p> Yep, between WPA2 to WPA3 there is 14 years 🤠 ! But it&#8217;s even funnier than that because most of the Wi-Fi vendors haven&#8217;t even implemented an <strong>UPDATE</strong> function on their devices. We could almost believe that they were not even expecting a third WPA standard 🤠! It&#8217;s a NO-NO even for those big companies that everyone uses their chips without knowing it. Well you have to believe that it is quite normal today to drive with a 14 year old car that we know the brakes can actually breake at any time!</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/OongkSFTbly8w/giphy.gif "alt =" gif "/><figcaption> YOLO as we say 🤠 </figcaption></center></p>
<h3> Did you know ? </h3>
<p> Do you know the principle of &#8220;Did you know? &#8220;? Usually, I don&#8217;t say no, but with WI-FI, we will have a good time, I can guarantee it!  </p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p> If you see some SSID (The names of Wi-Fi networks, eg FBI Surveillance) it also means that you are actually receiving the network packets of different devices connected to those networks. As each packet contains a header to know which network it is connected to, we can determine how many devices are connected to a network. Another important field, the MAC address that is defined by the manufacturer of the device is also indicated. Which means that even without being authenticated to the network, I can know exacly  which and how many devices are connected to a network. Hell yeah ! Enjoy your privacy in 2019 🤠 !</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/1236TCtX5dsGEo/giphy.gif" alt = "gif"/></center></p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p> Wi-Fi implements a function to deauthenticate all users on a network, quite useful if you want to annoy all your neighborhood !</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/XreQmk7ETCak0/giphy.gif "alt =" gif "/></center></p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p> On public Wi-Fi networks , everyone has access to everyone&#8217;s data, so if you are enjoying a tasty Happy Meal at a well-known restaurant and for any reason you are connecting to your Minecraft server in FTP, the Wi-Fi hotspot will actually sends your password in clear in the air within an area of 26 576,97 m² (the maximum range of a wifi hotspot being 92 m indoors)</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/OqBEghKMTW79m/giphy.gif" alt = "gif"/><figcaption> this packet is afraid to be intercepted 🤠 </figcaption></center></p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p> There is actually no control to know who is whom on a wifi network. For instance, if I deauthenticate you from your wifi router, and I sneak to your doorstep to turn on a fake access point with the same name of your real access point. There is no way for you to say &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s a bad guy at my doorstep performing a traffic redirection &#8220;. You will simply give me all your data including all your passwords thinking that it&#8217;s your usual connection.</p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p>There is still a significant number of Wi-Fi networks still under WEP in the world. For example, in 2015, 36.5% of Wi-Fi networks in Paris could be accessed without any password, and no less than 61.5% of Wi-Fi networks were password protected but used a poor encryption method such as, for example, just totally random picked: WEP. The study was carried out on &#8220;Avenue de l&#8217;Opera&#8221;, along the Seine and up to Notre-Dame de Paris, where 7,523 Wi-Fi networks belonging to hotels, cafés, offices and private residences were identified.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPznTgmcQGOlqyA/giphy.gif" alt="gif" /><figcaption>Don&#8217;t even think about getting free WI-FI !! 🤠</figcaption></center></p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p>Since August 2010, boxes with less than € 5 that work without human intervention, automatically search for WEP connections 1 km away, decode them and thus provide a free Internet connection to any computer connected to it, regardless of the system. exploitation. they also allow by extension to listen to the network in order to capture all the passwords that circulate on it. All as anonymous as illegal.</p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p>China has its own national standard to replace WPA named WAPI for WLAN Authentication Privacy Infrastructure.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9KVAN7Jvn22hekdG/giphy.gif" alt="gif" /><figcaption>This country will never stop surprising me 🤔</figcaption></center></p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p>Although WPA3 is supposed to be operational since January 2019, its key feature called OWE for &#8220;Opportunistic wireless Encryption&#8221; is still unavailable. If this feature was available, it would make the example of the Minecraft FTP connection over the hotel wifi just impossible. Even if according to Wikipedia, an attack of this kind is still possible even with OWE. Well, WPA3 remains a colander, a modern colander certainly, but a colander anyway!</p>
<h5> Verdict </h5>
<p>For better or for worse, Wi-Fi is ubiquitous today and although it&#8217;s quite practical and effective in terms of speed, Wi-Fi is all but privacy friendly.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there is far too few quality of what user get at the end. We are deploying always more Wi-Fi hotspot, always more powerful, ever more practical, but without solving the real problems it poses. I&#8217;ll say it right away, don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m carpeting into my cave with a foil hat and screaming &#8220;BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING ME&#8221; all the time !</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the first to use Wi-Fi in hotels or in McDonald&#8217;s between two French-fries with ketchup to watch youtubes poop videos. However, I think that Wi-Fi problems are a bit like Iphones, we always add new innovative features and make sure to fully exploit the potential of the device without solve the problem #1 which could break everything: the battery with Iphones and the privacy what is,even more important. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Do you use Adblock, Ublock or any other extension to block ads? In my case, I do so. It&#8217;s quite simple, I simply can not use a browser if I do not have an ad blocker installed!</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/ynmzKmA.jpg" style = "width: 50%; height: 50%" /><figcaption></center>A meme that explains my situation quite well 🙂 </figcaption>The problem with this kind of extensions is that they use a lot of processor/memory resources in addition to having to be installed on a browser to work. I know right, there are some browsers with built-in ad blockers but sometimes we just have neither the browser choice nor the ability to install an extension.</p>
<p>Sometimes we just want it to work, like a charm, naturally, without having anything to do, on all devices, pretty out-of-the-box though.</p>
<p>If you think as me, then you are at the right place, because today I suggest you this little tutorial <a href="https://blog.tchernobyl.ml/category/diy/"> DIY </a > in order to definitively end the ads.</p>
<h3> Ingredients: </h3>
<p>&#8211; a Raspberry Pi 🍓 (sorry there was no more raspberry emojis)<br />
&#8211; an SD card, a 4 GB SD card should be more than enough.<br />
&#8211; an USB power supply (if you don&#8217;t have the official Raspberry power supply on hand, your <strong> USB </strong> phone charger is enough.<br />
&#8211; a Linux distribution, the most popular on Raspberry Pi being Raspbian, we will use Rapsbian, but any distro does the trick!<br />
&#8211; another computer (to configure our Raspberry)</p>
<h3> Prepare the ground: </h3>
<p>Usually, when unbox your Raspberry Pi, there is nothing installed, let&#8217;s fix this by plugging your SD card into the SD card reader of your other computer to install Raspbian as specified on this little <a href="https://blog.tchernobyl.ml/diy/etcher-or-make-a-usb-bootable-on-linux-mac-os-or-meme-windows/"> tutorial </a></p>
<p>After that, we activate the SSH service of our Raspberry Pi by going into the boot partition (and not the /boot folder at the root).Once you are in the right partition, simply create an empty file named &#8220;ssh&#8221;.</p>
<p>Insert the SD card into the raspi port and you&#8217;re good to go. Turn everything on and SSH-connect to the Raspberry Pi:</p>
<p><Pre><br />
ssh pi @ [LOCAL_RASPI_ADDRESS]<br />
</Pre></p>
<p>The default password is: &#8220;raspberry&#8221;</p>
<p>You can achieve that with the Bash terminal on Unix OS&#8217;s (Linux, BSD&#8217;s, Mac OS&#8230;) or with Putty on Windows</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/YJJ5KN3.png" /><figcaption></center>we put the IP of the Raspberry in the IP field </figcaption><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/e4pV7nU.png" /><figcaption></center>then we put the word of 🙂 </figcaption>Once you have the remote control over the RPI, change at least the password of the default user to ensure a minimum security with the command:</p>
<p><Pre><br />
pi @ raspberry: ~ $ passwd<br />
Current password: &#8220;raspberry&#8221;<br />
New password: [ANYTHING_BUT_&#8221;raspberry&#8221;_!_!_!]<br />
Confirmation of password: [the same password as previously entered 🤠]<br />
</Pre></p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to talk about the solution I chose: &#8220;Pi-Hole&#8221;. It&#8217;s a free and Open-Source solution, simplistic as hell which allows us to solve our little advertising problem in a quite intuitive and efficient way. Indeed, once we have implemented the solution, the Raspberry will play the role of &#8220;filter&#8221;.</p>
<p>The installation of Pi-Hole is very simple:</p>
<pre>
pi @ raspberry: ~ $ curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
</pre>
<p>the script should start:</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/rHChPdC.png" /><figcaption></center>What a raspberry &#8230; 😍 </figcaption></center></p>
<p>We run the installation script by navigating with the arrow keys on the keyboard until this step which I think is the most important of all. Those who read my article on <a href = "https://blog.chernobyl.ml/diy/les-dns-or-how-to-review-the-control-on-the-life-privates-a-step -a-time / "rel="noopener noreferrer"target =" _ blank "> DNS </a> (<a href =" https://blog.tchernobyl.ml/diy/les-dns-or-how- -repert-the-control-on-its-private-life-a-step-at-a-time / "rel="noopener noreferrer"target =" _ blank "> here </a>) will know what to choose 🤠.<br />
<center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/wnfcdov.png" /></center></p>
<p>Once the installation is complete, the address of an administration page and your password to access it are given, remember the password ! If you prefer another password, you can always change it via the command:</p>
<pre>
pi@raspberry:~ $ sudo pihole -a -p
</pre>
<p>Once everything is set up we just check that the admin page works, if all everything is fine you should deal with a page like this:</p>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/s6aW8Yq.png" /></center></p>
<p>From there, you can configure Pi-Hole at your leisure or put finer settings if you wish. The advantage with this tool is we actually can monitor everything and potentially block everything, so please be careful to become a mini NSA or a Big Brother ! ☹️</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/0oYW3Ta.jpg" /><figcaption></center>This is typically the example not to follow 😥 </figcaption></center></p>
<p>From now on, you do as you feel! Indeed, you have three deployment choices:</p>
<p>&#8211; The sweet way, by replacing the DNS IP address on your router by the IP address of your Raspberry Pi. That way, It will change for you the DNS server settings of all other devices on the network.</p>
<p>&#8211; The fine way (or &#8220;case by case&#8221;), by changing the the DNS IP address of each device you want to &#8220;free&#8221; of ads.</p>
<p>&#8211; The radical way, disable DHCP from your router and let the Raspberry do it all alone via the built-in DHCP server.</p>
<p>The three methods will of course work. It only depends on how you choose to work. Personally I have a preference for the sweet way, because it is the one that I think is the least headache. For example, if you buy a new device, no configuration is required for this device because it will automatically retrieves the Raspberry IP address via your router.</p>
<h3> Verdict </h3>
<p>To have tested Pi-Hole, I must admit that this is the kind of solution as I like. Namely very easy to install, ultra simple to configure because it&#8217;s this kind of solution that will be the most effective. All served with a tastefully documentation that of course allows you to go further.</p>
<p>Voilà ! I hope you enjoyed this article, don&#8217;t hesitate to make your own idea and comment. We don&#8217;t change good habits, if you found this little DIY useful, spread it ! I&#8217;ll see you soon for a new article!</p>
<p>Until then, stay cool and drink water because water is life !</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Do you know &#8220;dd&#8221;? No ? This is a small GNU binary, surely one of the most essential that could exists. It allows you to do a lot of things. It cas even make your USB devices/SD cards &#8220;bootable&#8221;.</p>
<p>For those who are already a lost, know that when you want to &#8220;burn&#8221; an operating system in order to install it, the real action is to make your device ( USB key, SD card, external hard drive &#8230;) &#8220;bootable&#8221;. For the purists, I&#8217;m aware that it&#8217;s not exactly that but hey! Keep in mind that you read a &#8220;reminder&#8221; 🤠</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/ajIAehf.jpg"></p>
<figure> &#8220;dd&#8221; would not sound like the diminutive for the Mother of Dragons? </figure>
<p></center></p>
<p>The issue with this wonder of nature (dd, not Daenerys !!) is that like many wonders of that kind, you have to put your hands in the grease to use it because it&#8217;s not for beginners on Mac OS nor Windows. This is why there are essentially only people who have already been able to manipulate a Linux who know &#8220;dd&#8221;.</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/oAdiJVV.jpg"><figcaption> This gentleman seems to know &#8220;dd&#8221; </figcaption></center></p>
<p>Until you taste to a Linux, here is a solution I&#8217;ve been using for a quite long time already: &#8220;Etcher&#8221; (or newly &#8220;Balena Etcher&#8221;).</p>
<p>The advantage with &#8220;Etcher&#8221; is that it&#8217;s one of those cross-platform and ultra-simplistic applications I like. Indeed Etcher can as well run on Linux, Mac OS or even Windows.</p>
<p>The interface is hyper simplistic:</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/Vw5Ymue.png"></center></p>
<p>There are literally three buttons, I don&#8217;t think we can do more &#8220;user friendly&#8221; </p>
<p>Thus, to make any storage bootable, you must:</p>
<p>1 °) Select the image .iso/.img of the operating system you want to install<br />
2 °) Select the removable storage (USB key, external hard disk, SD card, &#8230;)<br />
3 °) &#8220;Flash!&#8221; or press the last button to make the removable storage &#8220;bootable&#8221; 🤠</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/iZrydEH.jpg"></p>
<figure> I wouldn&#8217;t said better 🤠</figure>
<p></center></p>
<h3> Verdict </h3>
<p>Etcher does not replace &#8220;dd&#8221; but allows you at least to make ALL (and I mean all) devices you attach to your computer fully &#8220;bootable&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which is, it must be admitted, quite useful when you break your Linux because of a bet with your friends and you&#8217;re in trouble because the only computer available to flash your USB stick is an old fashioned Mac OS or a rotten Windows (Sounds like there&#8217;s a story 🤠)</p>
<p>In addition, I find this tool puts a real order in all the whole bunch of &#8220;Unetbootin,&#8221; Rufus &#8220;,&#8221; Linux live iso &#8220;and derivatives of all kinds which I find too unnecessary difficult to use .</p>
<p>Voilà ! I hope you enjoyed this article, don&#8217;t hesitate to make your own idea and comment. We don&#8217;t change good habits, if you found this little DIY useful, spread it ! I&#8217;ll see you soon for a new article!</p>
<p>Until then, stay cool with monkeys and drink water because water is water and water is life !!</p>

<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/joV1k1sNOT5xC/giphy.gif" alt = "skype"><figcaption> When Microsoft announced it quietly 🤠 </figcaption></center></p>
<p>I realize that some people won&#8217;t even find the usefulness of making a post on it but for the others (and I know a lot !) who can&#8217;t simply imagine the word &#8220;Videoconference&#8221; rhyme with anything other than Skype, I have something that might interest you:</p>
<h3> Wire </h3>
<h3> 1 °) What is it? </h3>
<p>Wire is above all a compagny but it&#8217;s also a fully open source and cross-platform software, which means that you can install it either on Linux, Mac OS, Android, IOS or even Windows. But before you install it, there are several &#8220;plans&#8221; a bit like slack for those who know. So you can create two kinds of account on the site &#8220;business&#8221; (paying) or &#8220;personal&#8221; (free), a mail and a password are more than enough to create a personal account.</p>

<h3> 2 °) Features </h3>
<p>Once your account is created and the app is installed, there&#8217;s not much left to do:</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/wire-screenshot-2.jpeg" alt = "macos"><figcaption> Wire on Mac OS 🤠 </figcaption></center>You can do everything as you would do on Skype, create conversation groups, add people to contacts, share your screen or your camera, share images,&#8230; All of that without having this feeling of being constantly monitored by the NSA or any other privacy killer. Indeed, all communications are encrypted end-to-end ! Which means that except the person you are chatting with, no one will know that your dog is called Medor, and not even Wire!</p>
<p>Here is the icing on the cake: Wire does not serve any ads (yup, it is still possible in 2019).</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/5VKbvrjxpVJCM/giphy.gif" alt = "macos"><figcaption> The epic face I&#8217;ve made when I saw there was 0% of ads 🤠 </figcaption></center></p>
<h3> 3 °) Verdict </h3>
<p>You may have already understood it, I&#8217;m totally under the spell of Wire. I have honestly tried a myriade of replacements to Skype and even Discord (yes, yes it&#8217;s possible), but every time there was something wrong. Except for Wire, where everything works like a charm, the quality of the audio, the design, everything is tasty!</p>
<p>Voilà ! I hope you enjoyed this post, don&#8217;t hesitate to make your own idea and comment. We don&#8217;t change good habits, if you found this post useful, spread it ! I&#8217;ll see you soon for a new article!</p>
<p>Until then, stay away from barbed wire and enjoy free <del>candies</del> softwares !!</p>
<p>NB: I&#8217;m not paid by Wire, it&#8217;s only my personal opinion about it ! </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Do you know what net neutrality is? If you don&#8217;t, here&#8217;s a quick reminder from Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Net neutrality or network neutrality is a principle that guarantees the equal treatment of all data flows on the Internet. This principle excludes, for example, any positive or negative discrimination with regard to the source, destination or content of the information transmitted over the network. </p></blockquote>
<p>I also remember that a few years ago it really made the buzz when the United States had decided bottle it, plenty of stars from all walks of life had shown their dissatisfaction with this measure that was profitable only for those juicy operators as AT&#038;T, Verizon and so on &#8230;</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/UOOrmYpZPwRm8/giphy.gif" alt = "US"></center></p>
<p>In Europe, fortunately, the institutions are still *against* the big companies wishing to end it (but for how long?).</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/l3mZ99WVXIFIGsZY4/giphy.gif" alt = "EU"></center></p>
<p>But if for any reason you&#8217;re in doubt about your Internet Service Provider (ISP), you can still do this simple<a href = "https://ip.lafibre.info/neutralite.php" rel="noopener noreferrer"target =" _ blank "> test </a> (<a href="https://ip.lafibre.info/neutralite.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> https: // ip.lafibre.info/neutralite.php </a>)</p>
<p>It couldn&#8217;t be easier :</p>
<p>Two pictures must be downloaded, one via HTTP, the other one via HTTPS, if one of the two pictures is lighter than the other then you are in trouble !!!</p>
<p>Indeed, if you notice a difference of size, then it is necessary to compare with reference one (ex: for the first picture, 43 225 bytes):</p>
<p>If it is the image in HTTP which is smaller, it may mean that your ISP is manipulating the images to reduce their size (and splutter in the process the principle of net neutrality 😠).</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/1236TCtX5dsGEo/giphy.gif" alt = "Bravo!"></center></p>
<p>If on the other hand it&#8217;s the HTTPS one, then you should quickly disconnect/reconnect your router and redo the test because it may be surely the sign that your internet connection is not safe 😰 !!!</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/xT39D0tJm471uhvhaU/giphy.gif" alt = "AV"><figcaption> This is called a good &#8220;Firewall&#8221; 🤡 </figcaption></center></p>
<p>In my case, I&#8217;ve made a small script that gave me this result:<br />
<Pre><br />
[✓] IMAGE_HTTP: 43,225<br />
| ✓] IMAGE_HTTPS: 43,225</p>
<p>[✓] The ISP is neutral!</p>
<p></Pre><br />
<center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/26tPo1I4XyWzIBjFe/giphy.gif" alt = "content"><figcaption> Yes, I pretty does the same in my room when I saw the results 🤠 </figcaption></center></p>
<p>I &#8216;ve written this script with Shell, because I honestly don&#8217;t know any lighter and easier langage on Linux/Mac OS&#8230;Nevertheless if you are the &#8220;happy&#8221; &#8220;&#8221; possessor &#8220;&#8221; of a Windows or if you just want to see me code a script for this beautiful and very friendly operating system #sarcasm don&#8217;t hesitate to let me know, I would be happy to help (it will be an opportunity to make a Github repository for the blog)!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but when I made my hacking debut and the only language I could &#8220;master&#8221; was Batch, I didn&#8217;t know about Linux!</p>
<p>the sake of mercy don&#8217;t judge me, I&#8217;m already ashamed enough to write it!</p>
<p>I was a real newbie, I even thought that all big hacking operations was done on Windows (I was so naive). One day a classmate reveals me the existence of BackTrack 5 r3 (newly GNU Kali Linux), I was so excited to do my very <strong> FIRST </strong> moves in the hackers world. Everything being, of course, emulated into a virtual machine (Virtual Box at the time  🤠), because I quote you &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to break my computer 😣&#8221; (ah ah, what so cute&#8230;)</p>
<p>Why am I telling you all this? It&#8217;s quite simple, when I was younger, Windows hacking distributions didn&#8217;t exist&#8230;</p>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cYOMBDF.png" alt="capture" /></center><br />
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KSkcVsS.png" alt="capture" /></center></p>
<p>Now, they do.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/RVZD5dJ5fviUg/giphy.gif" alt="meme" /></center></p>
<p>To be completely honnest with you, I&#8217;ve completely missed out the news to such an extent that if I&#8217;m writing this post, it&#8217;s only because some of you asked me what I think about it&#8230; (don&#8217;t hesitate to continue to write to me, it&#8217;s a pure delight to read you).</p>
<p>Initially, I must admit that I believed in a prank or some fake news. That&#8217;s why I checked out by myself&#8230; I stayed a couple of minutes displaying a pretty good pokerface. In fact, I don&#8217;t know if I have to laugh or if I have to cry with laughter at the fact that &#8220;This time, it&#8217;s official, in 2019 Windows has finally two &#8220;distributions&#8221; and they are both oriented hacking&#8221;.</p>
<p>The regulars know, I like make fun of Windoze and perhaps besides it makes laugh only me but I find quite hilarious the fact of actually putting &#8220;Windows&#8221; and &#8220;Hacking&#8221; in the same sentence.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/HyvjlU00Ad4xq/giphy.gif" alt="hackerus windowsius" /><figcaption> an authentic specimen of hackerus windozius 🤠 </figcaption></center></p>
<p>Seriously, I&#8217;ve tested these two Lin..Windows distributions and I can confirm you that they are as bloated af.</p>
<p>First of all, be aware that these two distributions are published by <strong> FireEye </strong>. For those who don&#8217;t know this name or would be a little more connected to video games, know that if <strong> Kaspersky </strong> is a bit the <strong> Ubisoft </strong> of computer security, <strong> FireEye </strong> is more the &#8220;Electronic Arts&#8221; (EA) of computer security. It indeed a big American company that has contracts everywhere in the world and which hunts for state-sponsored or more I like to say &#8220;ennemies&#8221;-state-sponsored hackers group with a non hidden pleasure.</p>
<p>In short, it&#8217;s the same entity that publishes these two distributions (which are closer to the software bundle than the real distribution).</p>
<p>So there are two bundles, the Malware Hunter/Forensic Engineer starter pack named &#8220;Flare VM&#8221; and the Pentester starter pack with Commando VM</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/eCqFYAVjjDksg/giphy.gif" alt="jean-hacker" /><figcaption> an authentic specimen of pentestus stated-powered in action🤠 </figcaption></center></p>
<p>To install one of the two versions (Flare VM or Commando VM), you must first had installed a virtual machine with Windows 7, <del> 8 </del >, 8.1 or <del> 9 </del> 10. Then you have to naviguate to the github repository associated with the version (<a href="https://github.com/fireeye/flare-vm "rel="noopener noreferrer"target =" _blank "> https://github.com/fireeye/flare-vm </a> or <a href =" https:// github.com/fireeye/commando-vm "rel="noopener noreferrer"target =" _blank "> https://github.com/fireeye/commando-vm </a>) to download and run a powershell script &#8220;Install.ps&#8221;.</p>
<p>When the script installed for 60 GB of hard disk (Yup, it&#8217;s in the *MINIMAL* required) here you are with your wallpaper changed</p>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cYOMBDF.png" alt="capture" /></center></p>
<h3> OR </h3>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KSkcVsS.png" alt="capture" /></center></p>
<p>There you go ! You are left to do the same thing as on <strong> GNU Kali Linux </strong> but in a less good manner and in two different downloads. Remind me why I laughed previously for &#8220;Windows&#8221; and &#8220;Hacking&#8221; in the same sentence. Oh yeah ! Because, you can&#8217;t simply use Windows without an antivirus programm, so how about turning it off to investigate on malwares !!! </p>
<p>What do you say ? &#8220;Yes, but this is has been specialy designed for Windows&#8221;? Would I have heard in the back of the room ? Ha ha &#8230; You&#8217;re so naive &#8230;</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/fYsyULfLlvBzW/giphy.gif" alt="lol" /><figcaption> I&#8217;m sure about more than one &#8220;Windozian&#8221; will have this reaction at the end of article  🤠 </figcaption></center></p>
<p>According to the github repository, &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/fireeye/flare-vm#pentest" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> https://github.com/fireeye/flare-vm # pentest </a> &#8220;to be more precise, it&#8217;s very clearly written that the&#8221; Pentest &#8220;part of Flare VM consists of&#8221; Windows binaries from Kali Linux &#8220;(Windows binaries from <strong> *GNU*</strong> Kali Linux). Thus, as you can imagine, it&#8217;s the same for Commando VM where again is specified &#8220;Windows binaries from Kali Linux&#8221; in addition to being confirmed in the &#8220;legal note&#8221; (<a href="https://github.com/fireeye/commando-vm#legal-notice "rel="noopener noreferrer"target =" _blank "> https://github.com/fireeye/commando-vm#legal-notice </a> for those who want to check).</p>
<p>Well, to enumerate the good points, there are some new features, as a semblance of package installer named <del"> *apt*</del > &#8220;cup&#8221;. You have also a brand new version 2.0 which brings, I quote you, &#8220;full of new changes&#8221; and which is obviously not installable via this same installer packages #wow.</p>
<p>In short, you may have already understood my point of view, I am far from agree to make my CTF&#8217;s or even my investigations on the heavily disabled twin brother of a poor &#8220;GNU Kali Linux&#8221;.exe</p>
<p>I may shoot on the messenger, but when I see the cost-benefit ratio of that idea, I simply can&#8217;t hold myself to tell me &#8220;Why?&#8221; :</p>
<p>Why try a distro on Windows when it just does not work! Seriously, you only have to look at the minimum required configuration: 4GB of RAM for 60GB of storage !!</p>
<p>Why not make a Linux distribution ? It would still have more credibility and viability than this 🙁</p>
<p>Why has it been necessary to wait to 2019 to see the first &#8220;hacking&#8221; distributions on Windows?</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/b8jefh8LnBmMw/giphy.gif" alt="questions" /></center></p>
<p>Until finding the answers of these philosophical questions surely without any answers though. You can still share the post to your friends or collegues if you want this site to grow. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m so happy every time when I see the number of visitors increasing, don&#8217;t hesitate to write me I read of course all your messages 🤠</p>
<p>Until then, stay away from fire and enjoy a relaxing shower !!</p>
