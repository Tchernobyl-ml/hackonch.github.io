<p>Hi everyone, </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start this article by a simple question, do you know what is a software bug ? Just to be sure, here&#8217;s a quick reminder :</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;A software bug is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. &#8220;</p><cite>Wikipedia</cite></blockquote>



<p>In our societies mostly powered by computers, bugs would be like real-life cheat codes. They could give you the power to break the matrix and do good or bad without ever leaving your confortable seat. The firsts to have understood it, was intelligence agencies all around the world.</p>



<p>You wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if I told you that these same persons are actually stockpiling every unreported bugs as potential <strong>cyberweapons</strong>.</p>



<h3>Bug Bounties and the way things are supposed to work </h3>



<p>Depending on the type of behavior, a bug can be quite valuable to discover, that&#8217;s why, software companies try to encourage bug reporting by offering to pay IT professionals and hackers a &#8220;bug bounty&#8221; of up to several thousand dollars to those who find them.</p>



<p>As instance, Twitter offered recently some <strong>$20,160.00</strong> for reporting a potential pre-auth remote code execution on the twitter&#8217;s virtual private network.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5VKbvrjxpVJCM/giphy.gif" alt=""/><figcaption>Well, that&#8217;s a pretty good bounty !</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>However, if these bugs are kept secret from the vendor, they become zero-day exploits for organizations as the CIA or any other government intelligence agencies. &#8220;Vault 7&#8221; leak on WikiLeaks revealed a culture wielding incredible power by hoarding these exploits at the expense of everyday citizens who rely on vulnerable infrastructure to run their lives. </p>



<p>These &#8220;superpowers&#8221; give criminals and government agencies the option to &#8220;skip&#8221; legal, constitutional, and technical questions faced by their behavior.</p>



<p>Even if companies offer bounties of up to a few thousands dollars for serious, newsworthy bugs, such efforts are meaningless with governments paying far more to keep these 0day exploits secret. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/DGkRR2874Yb5u/giphy.gif" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>Today, hackers are offered far more to keep bugs a secret for truly valuable exploits, particularly ones that compromise user&#8217;s privacy and cyber espionage</p>



<p>While some rewards miles from United Airlines might be alluring to an aspiring hacker, an exploit allowing tracking of international travel patterns might be worth real cash to a cyber-arms broker or government agency.</p>



<h3>Bugs as Zero-Day Exploits </h3>



<p>There&#8217;s a saying about artillery that applies to cyberweapons: &#8220;If the enemy is in range, so are you.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t take a lot of common sense to realize an exploit won&#8217;t remain secret if you try warn some people about it but not the others, leaving you just as exposed as the intended targets.</p>



<p>The revelation of the advanced capabilities of the NSA badly damaged faith in American tech companies. In response, the Obama administration acknowledged that it was possibly not a great idea to have all these great weapons that rely on zero-day exploits in devices American infrastructure runs on. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/oND3prYUKFgnm/giphy.gif" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>The administration, in the interest of national security, agreed to release critical bugs to vendors to enable the &#8220;hardening&#8221; of American devices and infrastructure.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t share this with Google for even $1 million.&#8221;</p><cite>Chaouki Bekrar, Vupen</cite></blockquote>



<p>At the opposite, many companies have sprung up that couldn&#8217;t care less about the bounties offered by software companies, such as French company Vupen, run by Chaouki Bekrar. When they attend hacking competitions, they keep the most valuable exploits for themselves.</p>



<p>&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t share this with Google for even $1 million,&#8221; Bekrar told Forbes. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to give them any knowledge that can help them in fixing this exploit or other similar exploits. We want to keep this for our customers.&#8221;</p>



<p>Vault 7 leaks has shown a culture that directly contradicts the Obama administration position, leading some security researchers to take selling zero-day exploits as a foregone conclusion. </p>



<p>Indeed, this precious leak showed that the CIA went against the administration policy, choosing instead to hoard exploits in a growing cyberwarfare capabilities arms race between some superpowers as the US, China, and Russia. </p>



<p>These weapons aim to cause casualties, damage, and destruction with a new type of warfare that has never been possible to wage before. Hoarding these zero days has real world consequences for users of these compromised devices, fueling a black market in cyberweapons that is just impossible to control.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o85fTbmA8BbUhJvri/giphy.gif" alt=""/></figure></div>



<h3>The Rise of Private Military Contractors in Cyberwarfare </h3>



<p>In war, PMCs (private military contractors) have been providing cost-saving value for governments since the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. Companies like Blackwater offered to solve problems the US government needed solved, and this has caused and explosion in the private arms market.</p>



<p>The legal showdown prompted by the FBI&#8217;s demand to Apple to produce iPhone malware drew international attention, but was suddenly resolved with a payment to an outside cybersecurity company. Just like that, a private contractor made over a million dollars to circumvent a legal process for the FBI. In fact, this is pretty common, with private cyberweapon marketplaces doing as much as $100,000,000 annually in sales.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jMMpNgA.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>This incident shed light on a growing trend of cyber mercenaries where companies specialize in weaponizing zero-day exploits for whoever pays them to. Like traditional arms brokers, the best paying customers are often those looking to do something illegal, criminal, or in violation of human rights. Groups like Hacking Team have been widely accused of enabling human rights abuses and selling cyberweapons to whoever will pay them, putting anyone with vulnerable devices at risk.</p>



<p>These weapons are known to proliferate and turn up domestically, trickling down to the civilian market as &#8220;spouse tracking&#8221; or &#8220;catch my spouse cheating&#8221; spyware to enable harassment, stalking, extortion, and other illegal activity. In particular, journalists and vulnerable people are routinely targeted by these less-elegant exploits of common vulnerabilities. But for hackers wanting to get paid, it&#8217;s often more profitable to sell interesting bugs to spies than to worry about end users affected by the vulnerabilities.</p>



<h3> The Growing Arsenal of Weapons Targeting an Increasingly Connected World </h3>



<p>As our lives become increasingly influenced by connected devices, it has never been easier to cause damage through the weaponized use of exploits. Once limited to taking down websites or erasing data, cyberweapons in 2019 have the capability to kill people and destroy physical infrastructure.</p>



<p>A tense political situation has caused an explosion in the grown of cyberweapons, with the military pumping government funds into the private sector to create new and more lethal weapons. </p>



<p>Unlike nuclear or conventional weapons, these weapons can be copied, transported, and used across the globe in a matter of seconds. The political value of these weapons, and the dazzling scope of power they provide, has led organizations like the CIA (Again) to create new and more interesting ways to make people vulnerable through the devices around them.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IydmRNCdEmqVchq/giphy.gif" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>Between the black and grey cyberweapons markets of zero-day exploits, and the government funded creation of more, these tools are growing increasingly sophisticated and powerful in scope. Thanks to the explosion in malware availability, users of modern technology globally are vulnerable to weapons that allow political control, extortion, and even national acts of sabotage or war.</p>



<p>In recent attacks in the Ukraine, Russia has deployed increasingly sophisticated cyberweapons in conjunction with disinformation attacks that deny citizens the right to an impartial understanding to the world around them.</p>



<p>The ability to present a person with false information from a supposedly trusted source and invade their private life represents a level of control and manipulation that can be abused and automated to a terrifying degree. </p>



<p>From invasive data collection, to targeted disinformation campaigns, to automated exploits of zero-day vulnerabilities, most users are unprotected against this kind of interference in their everyday lives.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/cteJ7ZUgPAJfq/giphy.gif" alt=""/></figure></div>



<h3>When Governments Stockpile Vulnerabilities, Private Citizens Lose Around the World</h3>



<p>An increasingly tense geopolitical situation is causing governments around the world to stockpile cyberweapons capable of destroying critical infrastructure and causing loss of life, while quietly testing and refining these weapons in global conflicts. </p>



<p>These weapons only work when governments pay to keep knowledge of these bugs secret and cyberweapons dealers accept payment to turn a blind eye to how their tools are used.</p>



<p>Everything from our traffic patterns to our understanding of what time it is relies on technology today. As we advance into a world of further automation and trust in the devices around us to run our lives and shape our understanding, we confront a the new reality of where technology fits into our lives today.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/JFmkQayDKwa5y/giphy.gif" alt=""/><figcaption>This situation about cyberweapons reminds you nothing ?</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Rather than safeguarding the world&#8217;s growing reliance on technology by disclosing and advancing development of zero-day vulnerabilities, the worlds governments are stockpiling methods of committing a new frontier of attacks against populations never targeted by such sophisticated weapons before.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>Users and developers of cyberweapons insist that the capacity is needed to track down terrorists and criminals using encryption and other methods that make them hard to trace. Copying these weapons, however, takes only a moment, and NSA tools developed to invade computer systems were recently lost only to resurface on the black market.</p>



<p>Criminals can buy software to spy on government employees, shut down power stations, disable metro fare collectors, or encrypt millions of dollars worth of data thanks to the diligent efforts of the NSA and private contractors working to satisfy government contracts.</p>



<p>As shown by the CIA leaks, the casual way in which government agencies have began to share purchased or developed exploits increases the proliferation of highly sophisticated malware and worsens the risk of it falling into the wrong hands. </p>



<p>Vault 7 documents show that the US and UK governments pay to join in on the fun of exploiting vulnerable devices under the promise to not warn vulnerable users in their own country or use the weapon on each other&#8217;s citizens—even though they could.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TYp1B3H.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption>Critical vulnerability in devices used by US citizens shared with a foreign government. Image by Edward Snowden/Twitter </figcaption></figure>



<p>The grey market purchase of a zero-day exploit in the Apple showdown prevented a potential constitutional confrontation that could have had far-reaching implications for digital privacy in America. Today, the cyber gray and black market provides governments a relief valve to attack the technology we rely on for privacy without outlawing encryption itself.</p>



<p>As these weapons grow in power and scale, we as citizen, need to debate and decide whether contributing to today&#8217;s stockpile of cyberweapons is worth putting the people around us, or around the world, at risk of having these tools used against them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hi everyone,</p>



<p>Before to start, I would like to use a bit of my little notoriety to write you a small poem I&#8217;ve made especially for the occasion:</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><em>Roses are red<br>Violets are blue<br>I&#8217;m not responsible<br>if the Russian Mafia comes to you !</em></p>



<p>That being said, we can finally start!</p>



<h3>#1 The context </h3>



<p>[IP ADDRESS] &#8211; [07/Apr/2019: 18: 01: 28 +0100] &#8220;\x03\x00\x00/*\xE0\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00Cookie: mstshash = Admin&#8221; 200 173 &#8220;-&#8220;&#8221;-&#8220;</p>



<p>As any good article, this one starts with a strange line. As we can see, the query is quite different from the classic ones:</p>



<p>[ADDRESS_IP] &#8211; [07/Apr/2019: 18: 01: 28 +0100] &#8220;/index.html&#8221; 200 18 &#8220;-&#8221; &#8220;-&#8220;</p>



<p>This difference could essentially means two things: either the request is malformed or it&#8217;s an attack.</p>



<p>The web server is managed by a friend, he asks me my opinion about the issue because he was quite intrigued by the response code &#8220;200&#8221; in the end wich means the request has been successful.</p>



<p>The thing is, if the request was malformed, it would never have had well-formed characters because it is precisely malformed. It was clear to me that this was an attack. Probably a mass attack, but still an attack.</p>



<h3>#2  A bit of information gathering </h3>



<p>I&#8217;ve started by searching some informations about the attacker&#8217;s IP address because it was basically all we had at this stage. For some reason this mysterious address was located in Russia 🤠🇷🇺</p>



<p>Nevertheless it wasn&#8217;t reported on public abuse IP lists and when we query out the IP, the server proudly display a IIS8 default website:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FA9ZPYF.png" alt=""/><figcaption>It must be said, the default IIS8 website looks great  🤠</figcaption></figure>



<p>Just out of curiosity I ran a light ports scan to know which services would be running. This would help me to have a small idea on ​​the server&#8217;s role.</p>



<p>Here is the result of the scan:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Starting at 2019-04-08 20:49 UTC
Nmap scan report for [IP_ADDRESS]
Host is up (0.019s latency).

</pre>



<h3>#3  The &#8220;Hack Back&#8221; </h3>



<p>In the vocabulary of cyber warfare there&#8217;s this word that comes up quite often and was popularized by the Active Cyber Defense Bill. This Bill stipulated, among other things, that the United States may reserve the right to perform a &#8220;Hack Back&#8221; if an institution is targeted by a cyber attack  </p>



<p>But what does this word mean concretely?</p>



<p>In fact it&#8217;s easy as pie, it&#8217;s when the victim successfully returns the attack against its author (who is usually totally caught off guard at that moment). On the morale of the attacker, a Hack Back is as devastating as unforeseen.</p>



<p>Why am I talking about Hack Back ? Back to the results of the scan, there&#8217;s a significant amount of active services on this server including one that has particularly wreaked havoc within a company in a previous article (<a href="https://hackonch.github.io/fun/how-to-lose-your-information-system-on-a-print-server/index.html">here</a>)</p>



<p>You may guessed it if you follow me, I&#8217;m talking about:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">445/tcp open Microsoft microsoft-ds Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 - 2012 microsoft-ds </pre>



<p>This is Samba, which live on port 445 by default and is used primarily for file sharing between multiple computers. For instance, it&#8217;s thanks to samba that we can do this:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FO9fc84.png" alt=""><figcaption>One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,<br>
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them💍</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Unfortunately, since 2017, Samba is also known to be particularly vulnerable. For example, with the flaw named &#8220;EternalBlue&#8221;, we can crash a Windows executing an old version of Samba:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/l2yzFXs.png" alt=""><figcaption>I didn&#8217;t miss this good old BSOD 🤠</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Another more useful example is the &#8220;EternalRomance&#8221; vulnerability that allows an attacker to take control of a computer if Samba is outdated.</p>



<p>You know, sometimes in movies there&#8217;s that moment when there&#8217;s a freeze frame with a voice-over telling something like: It was at this moment that everything f*cked up ! Well, here we are, it was at this precise moment that everything f*cked up !</p>



<p>I was just going to run a last scan just to report the IP. Absolutely truthful fact, I misstyped the script path and I lauched inadvertently the EternalRomance exploit wich ended up with this result:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zo4jcvO.png" alt=""/></figure>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/swrTFeuOt2v6g/giphy.gif" alt=""/><figcaption>Wait what ?!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>For those who may be not familiar with Metasploit, it seems that the EternalRomance attack allowed me to have access to the adminitrator&#8217;s session. I was quite surprised, honestly, I didn&#8217;t really expect to break into a Russian hacker&#8217;s control and command server !</p>



<p>It must be said that, even if I was terribly excited, I was also a little bit scared, because I&#8217;ve entered into the wolf&#8217;s lair.</p>



<p>To get more confortable, I took a &#8220;screenshot&#8221; with the command of the same name:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XMLAw7o.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption>Oh! So that&#8217;s what the behind the scenes looks like? 😮</figcaption></figure>



<p>As can be seen in the screenshot, the host is likely to used as a control and command center (C&amp;C) for several botnets. In any case, this hypothesis could explain the presence of so many open ports during the previous port scan.</p>



<p>If we assume that there&#8217;s a control center on each open port, it would mean that this server controls a total of 8 botnets (listening on ports 1025,1026,1027,1028,1029,1030,1031 and 1034). Indeed, it could make sense because listening ports are following each other and it&#8217;s rare enough to be highlighted.</p>



<p>Anyway, at this point, we had enough control over the server to shutdown all the botnets once for all. Indeed, the malicious softwares used by the Russian hacker has a feature that can completely remove the infected host from the botnet. Applied to all infected hosts would definitely result in the simple and permanent dismantling of all botnets controlled by the server.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/eoxomXXVL2S0E/giphy.gif" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>We simply chose with my friend to don&#8217;t do it. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xTk9Zxw5LoEOuCLCQE/giphy.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Your reaction at that moment 🤠</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Indeed, turning off 8 botnets among all the variety of botnets on the Internet would be like taking a water glass off the ocean. In addition, the hacker could always redo other botnets elsewhere. </p>



<p>And then, even if the act could seem praiseworthy at first glance, there&#8217;s this little note that makes it even reprehensible: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act">The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.</a></p>



<p>Since we are not empowered by the nation to respond, the best thing to do was to simply report the infraction to the appropriate authorities. </p>



<p>However, it should be noted that, even if we had reported the infraction 4 months ago, the server is still running and operational (hence the censorship of IP addresses to prevent any Shadow Brokers wannabes).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uYegwDo.png" alt=""/><figcaption>At least, the server is now indexed by Shodan</figcaption></figure>



<h3> Conclusion </h3>



<p>I may repeat myself but I find it really damaging that the legal process is so burdensome. If a sort of law provision could be issued to legalize the *ethical* Hack Back and not &#8220;pre-textual&#8221; as in the Active Cyber Defense Bill, I honestly think that it would be a considerable step forward in our hyper connected societies where the violations of our privacy are too often common.</p>



<p>Seriously, just imagine a world, where the bad hackers would no longer be predators but prey. Imagine a world where spreading chaos and desolation over information systems only because it&#8217;s stylish to do so is no longer stylish. Imagine a world where xXdathackerXx would no longer attack Darbix62&#8217;s internet connection on Minecraft only because I quote &#8220;Yea I&#8217;m a real ononymous, yesterday, I hacked my middle school website so stfu&#8221; dixit the person who has simply overloaded his own connection.</p>



<p>I dream of a world like this ! Anyway, until this world becomes reality, you can still share the article if you liked it, it&#8217;s pretty important. You can also follow me on twitter to miss don&#8217;t miss anything !</p>



<p>In the meantime, stay well, be kind to your domestic plankton and see you soon !</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>As you may already know, I like to pamper the site. I&#8217;ve been preparing for a long time a checklist to always optimize the site and why not, improve it.</p>
<p>I checked about 95% of the checklist. Everything worked like a charm except a small detail I&#8217;ve forgotten: the visibility. </p>
<p>In all honesty, I have to admit that at the very beginning, I didn&#8217;t care that much. All I wanted was to keep a small site to train to write by writing some articles on this or that and why not, give my opinion if a couple of persons pass through there.</p>
<p>The time has passed and the traffic on the site has rapidly exploded. For comparison, earlier I said that I was happy if a couple of persons visite the site but today it&#8217;s 60 000 people who go there every month!</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xTiTnw6Yg5nzWwQh5C/giphy.gif" alt="awesome" /><figcaption>THAT&#8217;S PRETTY AWESOME !<br />
</figcaption></center></p>
<p>Well, we must admit, it&#8217;s not the same traffic as Google or Amazon, but it still remains not bad at all for a small non-profit blog !</p>
<p>All this to say that the site&#8217;s policy has slightly changed and will continue to evolve. Here is a little recap for more clarity:</p>
<h3>What won&#8217;t change:</h3>
<ul>
The blog will continue to promote Privacy.<br />
The blog will remain Anti-Google, Anti-Amazon, Anti-Facebook, Anti-Apple, Anti-Microsoft (anti-GAFAM in short) and thus, Pro-OpenSource, Pro-GPL and Pro-Linux.</ul>
<h3>What has changed:</h3>
<ul>
The blog is now available in several languages ​​(English and French).<br />
The blog will adopt a small banner about the use of cookies in accordance with regulations imposed by the CNIL.<br />
The blog tends to popularization (Explanation of acronyms and technical terms, definitions links &#8230;)</ul>
<p>And finally the most important point: The blog gets a new look with a new name, &#8220;hackonch.github.io&#8221;.<br />
Indeed, search engines used to drown too often the site under a ton and a half of links related to the Chernobyl catastrophe. It would be like making a website called &#8220;terminator&#8221;, you could always advertise it, but it would still be a real hassle to access it via search engines. In addition, many people took the site for a joke with &#8220;Tchernobyl&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why there will be a redirection to this domain name. Attention, although quite useful, this redirection is only temporary! Remember to update the link in your favorites or press Crtl + D!</p>
<p>Voilà! See you soon for a new article (already in preparation). In the meantime, feel free to share and follow me on twitter (link below)</p>
<p>In the meantime, stay well, be kind to your pets and drink water!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p>Do you know Baldr? No ? Let me rephrase my question. Do you cheat on games like Counter Strike, Apex Legends, PUBG or in a nutshell on any other popular games ?</p>
<p>If the answer is yes, well, you have to consider your house being the next target of the Area 51 facebook storm group because it&#8217;s due to people of your kind that I just can&#8217;t manage to get Prestige 70 on Cole Off Douty Modern Advanced Warfare 3 !! </p>
<p>Well, more seriously, you have to know that some quacks have managed to make profit of cheaters by making a botnet essentially composed of&#8230; cheaters !</p>
<h3>1 °) The infection </h3>
<p>To spread their virus, the Baldr team has decided to make quite credible videos to cheat on a whole bunch of games, the whole uploaded on our beloved Youtube. You know, this same Youtube that did the &#8220;spring-cleaning&#8221; recently by deleting a whole bunch of hacking related videos. Irony of fate or real stroke of genius, their videos are still online on YouTube even after this so-called and so contested cleansing. Since they don&#8217;t do things in half, they also advertised their videos on Discord mainly to attract <del>cheaters</del> gamers.</p>
<p>These videos are posted from several accounts and they all have a link in the description. The link leads to an archive, which once unzipped and injected into the game&#8217;s files, can actually permit to cheat on the game, either by shooting faster or by seeing the enemies through the walls.</p>
<p>Well, that was the funny part or as I like to call it &#8220;the immersed part of the iceberg&#8221;. Let&#8217;s now see the submerged one, namely the less fun part.</p>
<h3>2 °) The submerged part of the iceberg</h3>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nspthUt.png" alt="price" ><figcaption>Not expensive at all 🤠</figcaption></center></p>
<p>Yes, as you see, Baldr steals all the passwords on the computer, including passwords that has been stored by the browser or by any other applications (such as Discord or FileZilla for instance) and then send them to the hacker who will eventually sell every account for a few dollars on the Dark Net. </p>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5yQGWvB.jpg" alt="and it's not over" ><figcaption>And it&#8217;s not over !</figcaption></center></p>
<p>Baldr turns also your PC into a well-docile zombie that will attack other computers with your Internet connection ! Oh, I see the crowd starting to make a fuss ! Unfortunately, this is still the best case, because your beloved Internet connection can also be rented, at prices that would get sick any Internet Service Provider, as an anonymous proxy or even worse, as a tor hidden service.</p>
<p>Oh I almost forgot the classic and the inevitable cryptocurrency mining !! Yeah, because even CPU usage is profitable to Baldr.</p>
<h3> 3 °) The origins </h3>
<p>So where does this evil beast come from? At first sight, it seems that Baldr was sold for the first time on underground forums hosted in Russia. </p>
<p>But, is Baldr really the sordid invention of Russian pirates? That&#8217;s another question.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VjQqbNl.png" alt="stats" /><figcaption> Some cool stats 🤠</figcaption></center> </p>
<p>Indeed, when we sit down and look for ten seconds the statistics of infections, we realize that Indonesia won the race with 21.85% against 14.14% for Brazil and it is only at the third place that Russia appears with <strong>*only*</strong> 13.68%. </p>
<p>Moreover, the code does not contain any sign of Cyrillic characters, everything is coded in a perfect English. There are also many similarities with other abominations of that kind like Azorult or GrandStealer because we can even talk about copy-paste</p>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uUjnkUC.png" alt="comparison" /><figcaption>Left: Azorult NetscapeToJSON cookie converter function, Right: Baldr NetscapeToJSON cookie converter function 🤠 </figcaption></center></p>
<p>And here is the icing on the cake: the software vendors has sent a note the May 31st to all customers in which they explain that the developer decided to stop the project. But rather than maintain themselves the software, these gentlemen kindly call their customers (mainly Russian by the way) to look for a replacement.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XK2ny0Q.png" alt="note" /><figcaption>The mysterious note from Baldr vendors</figcaption></center></p>
<h3> 4 °) What is Baldr concretely? </h3>
<p>For me, Baldr belongs to a well-defined category of malware that I like to define with the following definition:</p>
<p>threat.exe: (mass name) Malware targeting <strong> *only* </strong> Windows, which is not very sophisticated but is still massively spreaded / used, thanks to &#8220;cyberkiddos&#8221; on «««hackers»»» forums (please note the quotation marks)</p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m about to break a myth, when we search a little bit on this kind of threat we generally reach the moment when we listen to a tutorial on how to build a genuine Russian botnet. The fact is, I quickly realized that the most of the time, the person talking is quite rarely more than 14 years old and tends to make videos on Roblox with all of its friends on its YouTube channel.</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/BoPbgjN.jpg" alt = "Oouuuh"><figcaption> Run for your lives !!! Here is the new generation of cybercriminals !!!! 🤠</figcaption></center></p>
<h3> 5 °) How to protect yourself + How to know if you are infected? </h3>
<p>Most of the time, when I&#8217;m dealing with these &#8220;threats.exe&#8221; many peoples tell me that I actually didn&#8217;t say how to protect ourselves or at least how to detect the infection. I&#8217;ll use this post to answer once and for all:</p>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Kamy9Dw.jpg" alt="true" /><figcaption></figcaption></center></p>
<p>I know, this is not the expected answer coming from a cybersecurity professional but this is the sad trust. Windows is a real colander, Windows 10 may be a more modern collander but a still a collander bloated and bugged as heck.</p>
<p><center> <img src = "https://i.pinimg.com/564x/ab/55/45/ab5545fba7c959d690d898f94cc70ecb--friday-humor-windows-.jpg" alt = "the same ones speak for themselves"><figcaption> memes talk by themselves 🤠</figcaption></center> </p>
<p>Security is a completely ABSENT concept on Windows, updates are a real clusterfuck, there is still a lot of Windows perfectly updated which are still prone to be exploited to vulnerabilities patched for ages <strong> <em> #Eternalblue </em> </strong>.</p>
<p>The very concept of antivirus, is a real aberration! If a system is well done, it is well done, that&#8217;s all. There is no need to fill any gap in its security.</p>
<p>Finally, I don&#8217;t know for you, but when I buy a tire for example, I don&#8217;t have to buy a coating to seal any hole on the tire ? Or I&#8217;ve been definitely fooled by a quack !</p>
<p>That was for the protection, the detection now! On Windows, you may not know it, but when you simply &#8220;listen&#8221;, with no open program, what your Windows sends on the Internet, you end up with this after only 30 seconds:<br />
<center> <img src = "https://i.imgur.com/9R8pfPv.png" alt = "capture"></center></p>
<p>This is a network capture made with Wireshark, an open source software. We can see on this frame capture that all in pale green or dark gray is all the communications your Windows has established with Microsoft telemetry servers.</p>
<p>On paper, telemetry allows Microsoft to know how you use your Windows. Of course, you are supposed to know what it is because during the installation of Windows, Microsoft actually asked your permission, but it&#8217;s absolutely normal that you have accepted because if you had refused, the installation would be aborted.</p>
<p>Microsoft simply violates your privacy with your permission.</p>
<p>Establishing a system that would filter all transmissions and that would drop suspicious transmissions (so, as a firewall) is simply impossible on Windows, it&#8217;s for this reason that no antivirus vendor has ever tried the maneuver. This is also why we never put firewalls on Windows clients, otherwise they don&#8217;t connect to Internet.</p>
<p><H3> Conclusion </h3>
<p>All of this to say once and for all that if you&#8217;re tired of your computer being abused by 13 year-olded kids or web giants, you can simply look for the alternative that suits your needs. I could also make it the subject of a future article if it interest you.</p>
<p>Voilà, I hope you like this article. Do not hesitate to share it with your friends or colleagues! </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to be happy, it&#8217;s the most important and see you soon!<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>A short time ago, one of my friends passionate into pentesting told me an anecdote. I want to make it clear that it is 100% truth and it happened in a medium-sized IT services company based in the US. Here we go !</p>
<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p>Last week, I was given access to a network that seemed at first sight quite secure.</p>
<p>As I am a little curious, the first thing I did when I settled was to run a network scan to see how many hosts were active and to have a vague idea of ​​the IS (Information System) of the company. All I had as information at this point was my IP address which informed me the address range of the floor. It was a tasty /24 as we like at a maximum of 254 hosts for the floor.</p>
<p>So I let nmap do his job with the information I had and when it finished, almost all devices were directly visible. I launched nmap a second time on a random host to see if something change. I compared then the second result with the first and I found something interesting. As the port 445 was open on almost all machines, I tried to launch an EternalBlue attack against a few hosts, but the connection failed every time I tried. Probably a firewall might block the connection but while trying to figure out what happened, I noticed another clue: a previously targeted device was named &#8220;PRINT-PC&#8221;.</p>
<p>Definitely curious about this strange device pretending to be a printer, I launched a third scan on it and I noted in addition to the Samba port (445) that the RDP port (3389) was also open. Naturally, I went to brute force the RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) password by taking care to use the username, I previously collected from the Eternalblue first try. After an &#8220;Eternal&#8221; minute, the software got stuck and repeats 1234 giving an error on each attempt. I open my RDP client to see what&#8217;s wrong and &#8230;</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.stack.imgur.com/o6GOJ.png" alt = "OMG" /><figcaption> The password was really 1234! 😱 </figcaption></center></p>
<p>I walked a little on the account I successfully broke in and, after digging a little, I found informations to say at least sensitive. About 2 GB of data in all. Afterwards, I didn&#8217;t miss to report the issue to the technical team.</p>
<p>It was at this exact moment, I had the worse idea that will, in less than 10 minutes, lead to a total chaos in the whole building. The idea was quite simple, if on a random floor, there is a device called &#8220;PRINT-PC&#8221;, it would probably mean that, there is a device called &#8220;PRINT-PC&#8221; on all other floors. No sooner said than done, I tried to connect to the same address by changing only the floor number with the same login. It worked once, twice, thrice and then I realized it would work with all other floors.</p>
<p>After that, I ran a well-known script to retrieve the NTMLv2 hashes to attempt a privilege escalation (the logical next step). Luckily I got almost all the hashes of all users in the building. The less glamorous thing though, was I made some noise in the network: the script broadcasted my IP on the PBX used by the staff directly from their machines and not from an external Cisco phone and that&#8217;s how after 5 minutes, I heard everyone complaining that &#8220;nothing was working&#8221;, not even the phones!</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/An4MkAbxeiyqY/giphy.gif" alt = "OMG" /></center></p>
<p>Despite all the panic, I still managed to do my little privilege escalation and open on a station near me a command prompt with the administrator rights! And although it&#8217;s true that just after, I had a hard time with the IT team, this story anecdote did my week!</p>
<h3> Conclusion </h3>
<p>Unfortunately, a poorly protected Windows printer server is enough to break all the security of an Information System. Add to the recipe a bit of luck (or bad luck) and you will an unseen chaos which can turn any normal day of a lambda employee into a remake of World War Z !!</p>
<p>Voilà ! I hope you enjoyed this short anecdote. Feel free to share it with your friends or colleagues! I&#8217;ll see you soon for a new article and why not a new story 🤠</p>
<p>In the meantime, be brave (why not ?), be kind with lamas and see you soon!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>If you read me regularly, you should know how a fervent supporter of privacy I am. Sometimes, I can even turn myself into a genuine government agent and go as far as possible into investigating and find out those responsible for general mass attacks (<a href = "https://hackonch.github.io/analysis-of-a-chinese-mass-attack-ft-codoso-team/" > here </a>) or, as more recently, attacks targeting a precise profile of users (<a href = "https://hackonch.github.io/investigation-russian-phishing-campaign-via-text-messages-on-leboncoin/"> there </a>)</p>
<p>As you may guess with the title of this post, we are not going to visit this time the confines of Russia or China to investigate on dark individuals. Nope, I suggest you instead to take a look at threats hanging over us, or should I say in your house! Yep, in your house, right now, or even at your workplace.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2K5jinAlChoCLS/giphy.gif" alt = "gif"/><figcaption>The reaction of many readers at this time of this post</figcaption></center></p>
<p>Indeed, with all these cases of mass espionage and high level hacking, there is IMHO too much a trend to neglect or even forget the risks of sending in the air its emails, its bank codes, its password or in one word: its data. Today, there are of course many so-called &#8220;wireless&#8221; protocols which allow us to send data to the air (Bluetooth, GSM, ZigBee, NFC, &#8230;). Today we will focus on one of the most used, you may have already guessed it and that&#8217;s the in the title of this post (coincidence?): WI-FI!</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/JEf4yZp4H1rMc/giphy.gif" alt = "gif"/></center></p>
<h3> A bit of history </h3>
<p> Wi-Fi is a set of standards for wireless networks developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE 802). Its first standard is published in 1997, and allows exchanges at a theoretical speed of 2 Mbit/s (it&#8217;s very slow nowadays). The set has been enhanced in 1999, with the publication of IEEE 802.11a and 802.11b standards which increase the theoretical throughput rate to 54 Mbit/s as well as a privacy protection system: the famous WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy). </p>
<p> It&#8217;s for WI-FI, the very first system to protect users against hackers. Except that<strong> Firstly </strong>, WEP was an option and therefore, a lot of people simply disregarded it. <strong> Secondly </strong>, in short, WEP used a robust encryption algorithm for that time. The fact, is we saw about 10 seconds ago that the performances had been increased by X27 between 1997 and 1999. You understand then that it was not necessary to wait a long time to be able to break the encryption used by WEP. For the cryptoaholics, the responsible all of this was the RC4 algorithm that breaks today less than ten seconds.</p>
<p> To replace WEP, in 2003 was designed WPA which is still widely used today. That&#8217;s why, if you check out your phone to find some wifi networks you should find a large number of WPA with a possibility of variant as WPA2 or WPA3 with a suffix &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;PSK&#8221; or &#8220;TKIP&#8221;.</p>
<p> <center><img src="https://pics.loveforquotes.com/%E7%B1%B3-wi-fi-looking-for-networks-turn-wi-fi-off-get-your-56421688.png" alt = "gif"/><figcaption> This one is a good one 🤭</figcaption></center> </p>
<h3> WPA in a few numbers </h3>
<p> Of course, WPA was not spared by vulnerabilities. But doing a little researches on our beloved Wikipedia, didn&#8217;t reveal a couple of flaws as WEP but: </p>
<p><center></p>
<h1> 9 flaws </h1>
<p> </center></p>
<p> Just that! But wait, this ins&#8217;t the worst part. Indeed, a few dozen known vulnerabilities in one of the most used protocols of the 21st century isn&#8217;t a bad sign but a pretty good one because it means that the publisher is aware of these flaws. In order to protect their customers, publishers can release a patch or even a workaround to continue to use the device safely until the patched version is released.</p>
<p> The real problem with WPA is that there is no versioning at all. Basically when WPA version 1.0 is released but unfortunately (or fortunately ?) in the meanwhile, some flaws are heard, these flaws are not patched immediately in a version &#8220;WPA version 1.1 patch&#8221;. No, no, no and there is the worst part ! When flaws are found, for example, on version 1.0 it is necessary to wait for the second version &#8220;WPA2&#8221; to hope to see them patched. If it&#8217;s reassuring for some people to see vulnerabilities patched in a year with WPA to WP2, how about waiting for:</p>
<p> <center></p>
<h1> 14 YEARS !!! </h1>
<p> </center></p>
<p> Yep, between WPA2 to WPA3 there is 14 years 🤠 ! But it&#8217;s even funnier than that because most of the Wi-Fi vendors haven&#8217;t even implemented an <strong>UPDATE</strong> function on their devices. We could almost believe that they were not even expecting a third WPA standard 🤠! It&#8217;s a NO-NO even for those big companies that everyone uses their chips without knowing it. Well you have to believe that it is quite normal today to drive with a 14 year old car that we know the brakes can actually breake at any time!</p>
<p> <center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/OongkSFTbly8w/giphy.gif "alt =" gif "/><figcaption> YOLO as we say 🤠 </figcaption></center> </p>
<h3> Did you know ? </h3>
<p> Do you know the principle of &#8220;Did you know? &#8220;? Usually, I don&#8217;t say no, but with WI-FI, we will have a good time, I can guarantee it!  </p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p> If you see some SSID (The names of Wi-Fi networks, eg FBI Surveillance) it also means that you are actually receiving the network packets of different devices connected to those networks. As each packet contains a header to know which network it is connected to, we can determine how many devices are connected to a network. Another important field, the MAC address that is defined by the manufacturer of the device is also indicated. Which means that even without being authenticated to the network, I can know exacly  which and how many devices are connected to a network. Hell yeah ! Enjoy your privacy in 2019 🤠 !</p>
<p> <center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/1236TCtX5dsGEo/giphy.gif" alt = "gif"/></center></p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p> Wi-Fi implements a function to deauthenticate all users on a network, quite useful if you want to annoy all your neighborhood !</p>
<p> <center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/XreQmk7ETCak0/giphy.gif "alt =" gif "/></center></p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p> On public Wi-Fi networks , everyone has access to everyone&#8217;s data, so if you are enjoying a tasty Happy Meal at a well-known restaurant and for any reason you are connecting to your Minecraft server in FTP, the Wi-Fi hotspot will actually sends your password in clear in the air within an area of 26 576,97 m² (the maximum range of a wifi hotspot being 92 m indoors)</p>
<p> <center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/OqBEghKMTW79m/giphy.gif" alt = "gif"/><figcaption> this packet is afraid to be intercepted 🤠 </figcaption></center> </p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p> There is actually no control to know who is whom on a wifi network. For instance, if I deauthenticate you from your wifi router, and I sneak to your doorstep to turn on a fake access point with the same name of your real access point. There is no way for you to say &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s a bad guy at my doorstep performing a traffic redirection &#8220;. You will simply give me all your data including all your passwords thinking that it&#8217;s your usual connection.</p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p>There is still a significant number of Wi-Fi networks still under WEP in the world. For example, in 2015, 36.5% of Wi-Fi networks in Paris could be accessed without any password, and no less than 61.5% of Wi-Fi networks were password protected but used a poor encryption method such as, for example, just totally random picked: WEP. The study was carried out on &#8220;Avenue de l&#8217;Opera&#8221;, along the Seine and up to Notre-Dame de Paris, where 7,523 Wi-Fi networks belonging to hotels, cafés, offices and private residences were identified.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPznTgmcQGOlqyA/giphy.gif" alt="gif" /><figcaption>Don&#8217;t even think about getting free WI-FI !! 🤠</figcaption></center></p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p>Since August 2010, boxes with less than € 5 that work without human intervention, automatically search for WEP connections 1 km away, decode them and thus provide a free Internet connection to any computer connected to it, regardless of the system. exploitation. they also allow by extension to listen to the network in order to capture all the passwords that circulate on it. All as anonymous as illegal.</p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p>China has its own national standard to replace WPA named WAPI for WLAN Authentication Privacy Infrastructure.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9KVAN7Jvn22hekdG/giphy.gif" alt="gif" /><figcaption>This country will never stop surprising me 🤔</figcaption></center></p>
<h5> Did you know? </h5>
<p>Although WPA3 is supposed to be operational since January 2019, its key feature called OWE for &#8220;Opportunistic wireless Encryption&#8221; is still unavailable. If this feature was available, it would make the example of the Minecraft FTP connection over the hotel wifi just impossible. Even if according to Wikipedia, an attack of this kind is still possible even with OWE. Well, WPA3 remains a colander, a modern colander certainly, but a colander anyway!</p>
<h5> Verdict </h5>
<p>For better or for worse, Wi-Fi is ubiquitous today and although it&#8217;s quite practical and effective in terms of speed, Wi-Fi is all but privacy friendly.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there is far too few quality of what user get at the end. We are deploying always more Wi-Fi hotspot, always more powerful, ever more practical, but without solving the real problems it poses. I&#8217;ll say it right away, don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m carpeting into my cave with a foil hat and screaming &#8220;BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING ME&#8221; all the time !</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the first to use Wi-Fi in hotels or in McDonald&#8217;s between two French-fries with ketchup to watch youtubes poop videos. However, I think that Wi-Fi problems are a bit like Iphones, we always add new innovative features and make sure to fully exploit the potential of the device without solve the problem #1 which could break everything: the battery with Iphones and the privacy what is,even more important. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Do you use Adblock, Ublock or any other extension to block ads? In my case, I do so. It&#8217;s quite simple, I simply can not use a browser if I do not have an ad blocker installed!</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/ynmzKmA.jpg" style = "width: 50%; height: 50%" /><figcaption></center>A meme that explains my situation quite well 🙂 </figcaption>The problem with this kind of extensions is that they use a lot of processor/memory resources in addition to having to be installed on a browser to work. I know right, there are some browsers with built-in ad blockers but sometimes we just have neither the browser choice nor the ability to install an extension.</p>
<p>Sometimes we just want it to work, like a charm, naturally, without having anything to do, on all devices, pretty out-of-the-box though.</p>
<p>If you think as me, then you are at the right place, because today I suggest you this little tutorial <a href="https://blog.tchernobyl.ml/category/diy/"> DIY </a > in order to definitively end the ads.</p>
<h3> Ingredients: </h3>
<p>&#8211; a Raspberry Pi 🍓 (sorry there was no more raspberry emojis)<br />
&#8211; an SD card, a 4 GB SD card should be more than enough.<br />
&#8211; an USB power supply (if you don&#8217;t have the official Raspberry power supply on hand, your <strong> USB </strong> phone charger is enough.<br />
&#8211; a Linux distribution, the most popular on Raspberry Pi being Raspbian, we will use Rapsbian, but any distro does the trick!<br />
&#8211; another computer (to configure our Raspberry)</p>
<h3> Prepare the ground: </h3>
<p>Usually, when unbox your Raspberry Pi, there is nothing installed, let&#8217;s fix this by plugging your SD card into the SD card reader of your other computer to install Raspbian as specified on this little <a href="https://blog.tchernobyl.ml/diy/etcher-or-make-a-usb-bootable-on-linux-mac-os-or-meme-windows/"> tutorial </a></p>
<p>After that, we activate the SSH service of our Raspberry Pi by going into the boot partition (and not the /boot folder at the root).Once you are in the right partition, simply create an empty file named &#8220;ssh&#8221;.</p>
<p>Insert the SD card into the raspi port and you&#8217;re good to go. Turn everything on and SSH-connect to the Raspberry Pi:</p>
<p><Pre><br />
ssh pi @ [LOCAL_RASPI_ADDRESS]<br />
</Pre></p>
<p>The default password is: &#8220;raspberry&#8221;</p>
<p>You can achieve that with the Bash terminal on Unix OS&#8217;s (Linux, BSD&#8217;s, Mac OS&#8230;) or with Putty on Windows</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/YJJ5KN3.png" /><figcaption></center>we put the IP of the Raspberry in the IP field </figcaption><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/e4pV7nU.png" /><figcaption></center>then we put the word of 🙂 </figcaption>Once you have the remote control over the RPI, change at least the password of the default user to ensure a minimum security with the command:</p>
<p><Pre><br />
pi @ raspberry: ~ $ passwd<br />
Current password: &#8220;raspberry&#8221;<br />
New password: [ANYTHING_BUT_&#8221;raspberry&#8221;_!_!_!]<br />
Confirmation of password: [the same password as previously entered 🤠]<br />
</Pre></p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to talk about the solution I chose: &#8220;Pi-Hole&#8221;. It&#8217;s a free and Open-Source solution, simplistic as hell which allows us to solve our little advertising problem in a quite intuitive and efficient way. Indeed, once we have implemented the solution, the Raspberry will play the role of &#8220;filter&#8221;.</p>
<p>The installation of Pi-Hole is very simple:</p>
<pre>
pi @ raspberry: ~ $ curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
</pre>
<p>the script should start:</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/rHChPdC.png" /><figcaption></center>What a raspberry &#8230; 😍 </figcaption></center></p>
<p>We run the installation script by navigating with the arrow keys on the keyboard until this step which I think is the most important of all. Those who read my article on <a href = "https://blog.chernobyl.ml/diy/les-dns-or-how-to-review-the-control-on-the-life-privates-a-step -a-time / "rel="noopener noreferrer"target =" _ blank "> DNS </a> (<a href =" https://blog.tchernobyl.ml/diy/les-dns-or-how- -repert-the-control-on-its-private-life-a-step-at-a-time / "rel="noopener noreferrer"target =" _ blank "> here </a>) will know what to choose 🤠.<br />
<center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/wnfcdov.png" /></center></p>
<p>Once the installation is complete, the address of an administration page and your password to access it are given, remember the password ! If you prefer another password, you can always change it via the command:</p>
<pre>
pi@raspberry:~ $ sudo pihole -a -p
</pre>
<p>Once everything is set up we just check that the admin page works, if all everything is fine you should deal with a page like this:</p>
<p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/s6aW8Yq.png" /></center></p>
<p>From there, you can configure Pi-Hole at your leisure or put finer settings if you wish. The advantage with this tool is we actually can monitor everything and potentially block everything, so please be careful to become a mini NSA or a Big Brother ! ☹️</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/0oYW3Ta.jpg" /><figcaption></center>This is typically the example not to follow 😥 </figcaption></center></p>
<p>From now on, you do as you feel! Indeed, you have three deployment choices:</p>
<p>&#8211; The sweet way, by replacing the DNS IP address on your router by the IP address of your Raspberry Pi. That way, It will change for you the DNS server settings of all other devices on the network.</p>
<p>&#8211; The fine way (or &#8220;case by case&#8221;), by changing the the DNS IP address of each device you want to &#8220;free&#8221; of ads.</p>
<p>&#8211; The radical way, disable DHCP from your router and let the Raspberry do it all alone via the built-in DHCP server.</p>
<p>The three methods will of course work. It only depends on how you choose to work. Personally I have a preference for the sweet way, because it is the one that I think is the least headache. For example, if you buy a new device, no configuration is required for this device because it will automatically retrieves the Raspberry IP address via your router.</p>
<h3> Verdict </h3>
<p>To have tested Pi-Hole, I must admit that this is the kind of solution as I like. Namely very easy to install, ultra simple to configure because it&#8217;s this kind of solution that will be the most effective. All served with a tastefully documentation that of course allows you to go further.</p>
<p>Voilà ! I hope you enjoyed this article, don&#8217;t hesitate to make your own idea and comment. We don&#8217;t change good habits, if you found this little DIY useful, spread it ! I&#8217;ll see you soon for a new article!</p>
<p>Until then, stay cool and drink water because water is life !</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Do you know &#8220;dd&#8221;? No ? This is a small GNU binary, surely one of the most essential that could exists. It allows you to do a lot of things. It cas even make your USB devices/SD cards &#8220;bootable&#8221;.</p>
<p>For those who are already a lost, know that when you want to &#8220;burn&#8221; an operating system in order to install it, the real action is to make your device ( USB key, SD card, external hard drive &#8230;) &#8220;bootable&#8221;. For the purists, I&#8217;m aware that it&#8217;s not exactly that but hey! Keep in mind that you read a &#8220;reminder&#8221; 🤠</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/ajIAehf.jpg"></p>
<figure> &#8220;dd&#8221; would not sound like the diminutive for the Mother of Dragons? </figure>
<p></center></p>
<p>The issue with this wonder of nature (dd, not Daenerys !!) is that like many wonders of that kind, you have to put your hands in the grease to use it because it&#8217;s not for beginners on Mac OS nor Windows. This is why there are essentially only people who have already been able to manipulate a Linux who know &#8220;dd&#8221;.</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/oAdiJVV.jpg"><figcaption> This gentleman seems to know &#8220;dd&#8221; </figcaption></center></p>
<p>Until you taste to a Linux, here is a solution I&#8217;ve been using for a quite long time already: &#8220;Etcher&#8221; (or newly &#8220;Balena Etcher&#8221;).</p>
<p>The advantage with &#8220;Etcher&#8221; is that it&#8217;s one of those cross-platform and ultra-simplistic applications I like. Indeed Etcher can as well run on Linux, Mac OS or even Windows.</p>
<p>The interface is hyper simplistic:</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/Vw5Ymue.png"></center></p>
<p>There are literally three buttons, I don&#8217;t think we can do more &#8220;user friendly&#8221; </p>
<p>Thus, to make any storage bootable, you must:</p>
<p>1 °) Select the image .iso/.img of the operating system you want to install<br />
2 °) Select the removable storage (USB key, external hard disk, SD card, &#8230;)<br />
3 °) &#8220;Flash!&#8221; or press the last button to make the removable storage &#8220;bootable&#8221; 🤠</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/iZrydEH.jpg"></p>
<figure> I wouldn&#8217;t said better 🤠</figure>
<p></center></p>
<h3> Verdict </h3>
<p>Etcher does not replace &#8220;dd&#8221; but allows you at least to make ALL (and I mean all) devices you attach to your computer fully &#8220;bootable&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which is, it must be admitted, quite useful when you break your Linux because of a bet with your friends and you&#8217;re in trouble because the only computer available to flash your USB stick is an old fashioned Mac OS or a rotten Windows (Sounds like there&#8217;s a story 🤠)</p>
<p>In addition, I find this tool puts a real order in all the whole bunch of &#8220;Unetbootin,&#8221; Rufus &#8220;,&#8221; Linux live iso &#8220;and derivatives of all kinds which I find too unnecessary difficult to use .</p>
<p>Voilà ! I hope you enjoyed this article, don&#8217;t hesitate to make your own idea and comment. We don&#8217;t change good habits, if you found this little DIY useful, spread it ! I&#8217;ll see you soon for a new article!</p>
<p>Until then, stay cool with monkeys and drink water because water is water and water is life !!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>If as me, you live in a cave, know that Microsoft will stop the Skype project development!</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/joV1k1sNOT5xC/giphy.gif" alt = "skype"><figcaption> When Microsoft announced it quietly 🤠 </figcaption></center> </p>
<p>I realize that some people won&#8217;t even find the usefulness of making a post on it but for the others (and I know a lot !) who can&#8217;t simply imagine the word &#8220;Videoconference&#8221; rhyme with anything other than Skype, I have something that might interest you:</p>
<h3> Wire </h3>
<h3> 1 °) What is it? </h3>
<p>Wire is above all a compagny but it&#8217;s also a fully open source and cross-platform software, which means that you can install it either on Linux, Mac OS, Android, IOS or even Windows. But before you install it, there are several &#8220;plans&#8221; a bit like slack for those who know. So you can create two kinds of account on the site &#8220;business&#8221; (paying) or &#8220;personal&#8221; (free), a mail and a password are more than enough to create a personal account.</p>

<h3> 2 °) Features </h3>
<p>Once your account is created and the app is installed, there&#8217;s not much left to do:</p>
<p><center><img src = "https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/wire-screenshot-2.jpeg" alt = "macos"><figcaption> Wire on Mac OS 🤠 </figcaption></center>You can do everything as you would do on Skype, create conversation groups, add people to contacts, share your screen or your camera, share images,&#8230; All of that without having this feeling of being constantly monitored by the NSA or any other privacy killer. Indeed, all communications are encrypted end-to-end ! Which means that except the person you are chatting with, no one will know that your dog is called Medor, and not even Wire!</p>
<p>Here is the icing on the cake: Wire does not serve any ads (yup, it is still possible in 2019).</p>

<h3> 3 °) Verdict </h3>
<p>You may have already understood it, I&#8217;m totally under the spell of Wire. I have honestly tried a myriade of replacements to Skype and even Discord (yes, yes it&#8217;s possible), but every time there was something wrong. Except for Wire, where everything works like a charm, the quality of the audio, the design, everything is tasty!</p>
<p>Voilà ! I hope you enjoyed this post, don&#8217;t hesitate to make your own idea and comment. We don&#8217;t change good habits, if you found this post useful, spread it ! I&#8217;ll see you soon for a new article!</p>
<p>Until then, stay away from barbed wire and enjoy free <del>candies</del> softwares !!</p>
<p>NB: I&#8217;m not paid by Wire, it&#8217;s only my personal opinion about it ! </p>
